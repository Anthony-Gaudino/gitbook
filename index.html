		<h1>Introduction</h1>

<h2>Welcome to Git</h2>

<p>Welcome to Git - the fast, distributed version control system.</p>

<p>This book is meant to be a starting point for people new to Git to learn it
as quickly and easily as possible.</p>

<p>This book will start out by introducing you to the way Git stores data, to
give you the context for why it is different than other VCS tools.
This is meant to take you about 20 minutes.</p>

<p>Next we will cover <strong>Basic Git Usage</strong> - the commands you will be using 90% of
the time.  These should give you a good basis to use Git comfortably for most
of what you're going to use it for.  This section should take you about 30
minutes to read through.</p>

<p>Next we will go over <strong>Intermediate Git Usage</strong> - things that are slightly more
complex, but may replace some of the basic commands you learned in the first
section.  This will mostly be tricks and commands that will feel more
comfortable after you know the basic commands.</p>

<p>After you have all of that mastered, we will cover <strong>Advanced Git</strong> - commands
that most people probably don't use very often, but can be very helpful in
certain situations.  Learning these commands should round out your day-to-day
git knowledge; you will be a master of the Git!</p>

<p>Now that you know Git, we will then cover <strong>Working with Git</strong>.  Here we will go
over how to use Git in scripts, with deployment tools, with editors and more.
These sections are meant to help you integrate Git into your environment.</p>

<p>Lastly, we will have a series of articles on <strong>low-level documentation</strong> that may
help the Git hackers who want to learn how the actual internals and protocols
work in Git.</p>

<h3>Feedback and Contributing</h3>

<p>At any point, if you see a mistake or want to contribute to the book, you can
send me an email at <a href="mailto:schacon@gmail.com">schacon@gmail.com</a>, or you
can clone the source of this book at

<h2>The Git Object Model</h2>

<h3>The SHA</h3>

<p>All the information needed to represent the history of a
project is stored in files referenced by a 40-digit "object name" that
looks something like this:</p>

<pre><code>6ff87c4664981e4397625791c8ea3bbb5f2279a3
</code></pre>

<p>You will see these 40-character strings all over the place in Git.
In each case the name is calculated by taking the SHA1 hash of the
contents of the object.  The SHA1 hash is a cryptographic hash function.
What that means to us is that it is virtually impossible to find two different
objects with the same name.  This has a number of advantages; among
others:</p>

<ul>
<li>Git can quickly determine whether two objects are identical or not,
just by comparing names.</li>
<li>Since object names are computed the same way in every repository, the
same content stored in two repositories will always be stored under
the same name.</li>
<li>Git can detect errors when it reads an object, by checking that the
object's name is still the SHA1 hash of its contents.</li>
</ul>


<h3>The Objects</h3>

<p>Every object consists of three things - a <strong>type</strong>, a <strong>size</strong> and <strong>content</strong>.
The <em>size</em> is simply the size of the contents, the contents depend on what
type of object it is, and there are four different types of objects:
"blob", "tree", "commit", and "tag".</p>

<ul>
<li>A <strong>"blob"</strong> is used to store file data - it is generally a file.</li>
<li>A <strong>"tree"</strong> is basically like a directory - it references a bunch of
  other trees and/or blobs (i.e. files and sub-directories)</li>
<li>A <strong>"commit"</strong> points to a single tree, marking it as what the project
  looked like at a certain point in time.  It contains meta-information
  about that point in time, such as a timestamp, the author of the changes
  since the last commit, a pointer to the previous commit(s), etc.</li>
<li>A <strong>"tag"</strong> is a way to mark a specific commit as special in some way.  It
  is normally used to tag certain commits as specific releases or something
  along those lines.</li>
</ul>


<p>Almost all of Git is built around manipulating this simple structure of four
different object types.  It is sort of its own little filesystem that sits
on top of your machine's filesystem.</p>

<h3>Different from SVN</h3>

<p>It is important to note that this is very different from most SCM systems
that you may be familiar with.  Subversion, CVS, Perforce, Mercurial and the
like all use <em>Delta Storage</em> systems - they store the differences between one
commit and the next.  Git does not do this - it stores a snapshot of what all
the files in your project look like in this tree structure each time you
commit. This is a very important concept to understand when using Git.</p>

<h3>Blob Object</h3>

<p>A blob generally stores the contents of a file.</p>

<p><div class="center"><img src="assets/images/figure/object-blob.png"></div></p>

<p>You can use <a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-show.html">git show</a> to examine the contents of any blob.
Assuming we have the SHA for a blob, we can examine its contents like this:</p>

<pre><code>$ git show 6ff87c4664

 Note that the only valid version of the GPL as far as this project
 is concerned is _this_ particular version of the license (ie v2, not
 v2.2 or v3.x or whatever), unless explicitly otherwise stated.
...
</code></pre>

<p>A "blob" object is nothing but a chunk of binary data.  It doesn't refer
to anything else or have attributes of any kind, not even a file name.</p>

<p>Since the blob is entirely defined by its data, if two files in a
directory tree (or in multiple different versions of the repository)
have the same contents, they will share the same blob object. The object
is totally independent of its location in the directory tree, and
renaming a file does not change the object that file is associated with.</p>

<h3>Tree Object</h3>

<p>A tree is a simple object that has a bunch of pointers to blobs and other
trees - it generally represents the contents of a directory or subdirectory.</p>

<p><div class="center"><img src="assets/images/figure/object-tree.png"></div></p>

<p>The ever-versatile <a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-show.html">git show</a> command can also be used to
examine tree objects, but <a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-ls-tree.html">git ls-tree</a> will give you more
details.  Assuming we have the SHA for a tree, we can examine it like this:</p>

<pre><code>$ git ls-tree fb3a8bdd0ce
100644 blob 63c918c667fa005ff12ad89437f2fdc80926e21c    .gitignore
100644 blob 5529b198e8d14decbe4ad99db3f7fb632de0439d    .mailmap
100644 blob 6ff87c4664981e4397625791c8ea3bbb5f2279a3    COPYING
040000 tree 2fb783e477100ce076f6bf57e4a6f026013dc745    Documentation
100755 blob 3c0032cec592a765692234f1cba47dfdcc3a9200    GIT-VERSION-GEN
100644 blob 289b046a443c0647624607d471289b2c7dcd470b    INSTALL
100644 blob 4eb463797adc693dc168b926b6932ff53f17d0b1    Makefile
100644 blob 548142c327a6790ff8821d67c2ee1eff7a656b52    README
...
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, a tree object contains a list of entries, each with a
mode, object type, SHA1 name, and name, sorted by name.  It represents
the contents of a single directory tree.</p>

<p>An object referenced by a tree may be blob, representing the contents of a
file, or another tree, representing the contents of a subdirectory.  Since
trees and blobs, like all other objects, are named by the SHA1 hash of their
contents, two trees have the same SHA1 name if and only if their contents
(including, recursively, the contents of all subdirectories) are identical.
This allows git to quickly determine the differences between two related tree
objects, since it can ignore any entries with identical object names.</p>

<p>(Note: in the presence of submodules, trees may also have commits as
entries.  See the <strong>Submodules</strong> section.)</p>

<p>Note that the files all have mode 644 or 755: git actually only pays
attention to the executable bit.</p>

<h3>Commit Object</h3>

<p>The "commit" object links a physical state of a tree with a description
of how we got there and why.</p>

<p><div class="center"><img src="assets/images/figure/object-commit.png"></div></p>

<p>You can use the --pretty=raw option to
<a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-show.html">git show</a> or <a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-log.html">git log</a> to examine your favorite
commit:</p>

<pre><code>$ git show -s --pretty=raw 2be7fcb476
commit 2be7fcb4764f2dbcee52635b91fedb1b3dcf7ab4
tree fb3a8bdd0ceddd019615af4d57a53f43d8cee2bf
parent 257a84d9d02e90447b149af58b271c19405edb6a

    Fix misspelling of 'suppress' in docs

    Signed-off-by: Junio C Hamano &lt;gitster@pobox.com&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, a commit is defined by:</p>

<ul>
<li>a <strong>tree</strong>: The SHA1 name of a tree object (as defined below), representing
the contents of a directory at a certain point in time.</li>
<li><strong>parent(s)</strong>: The SHA1 name of some number of commits which represent the
immediately previous step(s) in the history of the project.  The
example above has one parent; merge commits may have more than
one.  A commit with no parents is called a "root" commit, and
represents the initial revision of a project.  Each project must have
at least one root.  A project can also have multiple roots, though
that isn't common (or necessarily a good idea).</li>
<li>an <strong>author</strong>: The name of the person responsible for this change, together
with its date.</li>
<li>a <strong>committer</strong>: The name of the person who actually created the commit,
with the date it was done.  This may be different from the author; for
example, if the author wrote a patch and emailed it to another person who
used the patch to create the commit.</li>
<li>a <strong>comment</strong> describing this commit.</li>
</ul>


<p>Note that a commit does not itself contain any information about what
actually changed; all changes are calculated by comparing the contents
of the tree referred to by this commit with the trees associated with
its parents.  In particular, git does not attempt to record file renames
explicitly, though it can identify cases where the existence of the same
file data at changing paths suggests a rename.  (See, for example, the
-M option to <a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-diff.html">git diff</a>).</p>

<p>A commit is usually created by <a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-commit.html">git commit</a>, which creates a
commit whose parent is normally the current HEAD, and whose tree is
taken from the content currently stored in the index.</p>

<h3>The Object Model</h3>

<p>So, now that we've looked at the 3 main object types (blob, tree and commit),
let's take a quick look at how they all fit together.</p>

<p>If we had a simple project with the following directory structure:</p>

<pre><code>$&gt;tree
.
|-- README
`-- lib
    |-- inc
    |   `-- tricks.rb
    `-- mylib.rb

2 directories, 3 files
</code></pre>

<p>And we committed this to a Git repository, it would be represented like this:</p>

<p><div class="center"><img src="assets/images/figure/objects-example.png"></div></p>

<p>You can see that we have created a <strong>tree</strong> object for each directory (including the root)
and a <strong>blob</strong> object for each file.  Then we have a <strong>commit</strong> object to point
to the root, so we can track what our project looked like when it was committed.</p>

<h3>Tag Object</h3>

<p><div class="center"><img src="assets/images/figure/object-tag.png"></div></p>

<p>A tag object contains an object name (called simply 'object'), object type,
tag name, the name of the person ("tagger") who created the tag, and a
message, which may contain a signature, as can be seen using
<a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-cat-file.html">git cat-file</a>:</p>

<pre><code>$ git cat-file tag v1.5.0
object 437b1b20df4b356c9342dac8d38849f24ef44f27
type commit
tag v1.5.0

-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----
</code></pre>

<p>See the <a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-tag.html">git tag</a> command to learn how to create and verify tag
objects.  (Note that <a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-tag.html">git tag</a> can also be used to create
"lightweight tags", which are not tag objects at all, but just simple
references whose names begin with "refs/tags/").</p>

<h2>Git Directory and Working Directory</h2>

<h3>The Git Directory</h3>

<p>The 'git directory' is the directory that stores all Git's history and meta
information for your project - including all of the objects (commits, trees,
blobs, tags), all of the pointers to where different branches are and more.</p>

<p>There is only one Git Directory per project (as opposed to one per
subdirectory like with SVN or CVS), and that directory is (by default, though
not necessarily) '.git' in the root of your project.  If you look at the
contents of that directory, you can see all of your important files:</p>

<pre><code>$&gt;tree -L 1
.
|-- HEAD         # pointer to your current branch
|-- config       # your configuration preferences
|-- description  # description of your project 
|-- hooks/       # pre/post action hooks
|-- index        # index file (see next section)
|-- logs/        # a history of where your branches have been
|-- objects/     # your objects (commits, trees, blobs, tags)
`-- refs/        # pointers to your branches
</code></pre>

<p>(there may be some other files/directories in there as well, but they are not important for now)</p>

<h3>The Working Directory</h3>

<p>The Git 'working directory' is the directory that holds the current checkout
of the files you are working on.  Files in this directory are often removed
or replaced by Git as you switch branches - this is normal.  All your history
is stored in the Git Directory; the working directory is simply a temporary
checkout place where you can modify the files until your next commit.</p>

<h2>The Git Index</h2>

<p>The Git index is used as a staging area between your working directory
and your repository.  You can use the index to build up a set of changes
that you want to commit together.  When you create a commit, what is committed
is what is currently in the index, not what is in your working directory.</p>

<h3>Looking at the Index</h3>

<p>The easiest way to see what is in the index is with the <a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-status.html">git status</a>
command.  When you run git status, you can see which files are staged
(currently in your index), which are modified but not yet staged, and which
are completely untracked.</p>

<pre><code>$&gt;git status
# On branch master
# Your branch is behind 'origin/master' by 11 commits, and can be fast-forwarded.
#
# Changes to be committed:
#   (use "git reset HEAD &lt;file&gt;..." to unstage)
#
#   modified:   daemon.c
#
# Changed but not updated:
#   (use "git add &lt;file&gt;..." to update what will be committed)
#
#   modified:   grep.c
#   modified:   grep.h
#
# Untracked files:
#   (use "git add &lt;file&gt;..." to include in what will be committed)
#
#   blametree
#   blametree-init
#   git-gui/git-citool
</code></pre>

<p>If you blow the index away entirely, you generally haven't lost any
information as long as you have the name of the tree that it described.</p>

<p>And with that, you should have a pretty good understanding of the basics of
what Git is doing behind the scenes, and why it is a bit different than most
other SCM systems.  Don't worry if you don't totally understand it all right
now; we'll revisit all of these topics in the next sections. Now we're ready
to move on to installing, configuring and using Git.</p>

<h1>First Time</h1>

<h2>Installing Git</h2>

<h3>Installing from Source</h3>

<p>In short, on a Unix-based system, you can download the Git source code from the
<a href="http://git-scm.com/download">Git Download Page</a>, and then run something
along the lines of :</p>

<pre><code>$ make prefix=/usr all ;# as yourself
$ make prefix=/usr install ;# as root
</code></pre>

<p>You will need the <a href="http://expat.sourceforge.net/">expat</a>,
<a href="http://curl.linux-mirror.org">curl</a>,
<a href="http://www.zlib.net">zlib</a>, and <a href="http://www.openssl.org">openssl</a> libraries
installed - though with the possible exception of <em>expat</em>, these will normally already
be there.</p>

<h3>Linux</h3>

<p>If you are running Linux, you can likely install Git easily via your native
package management system:</p>

<pre><code>$ yum install git-core

$ apt-get install git-core
</code></pre>

<p>If that doesn't work, you can download the .deb or .rpm packages from here:</p>

<p><a href="http://kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/RPMS/">RPM Packages</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.backports.org/debian/pool/main/g/git-core/">Stable Debs</a></p>

<p>If you prefer to install from source on a Linux system, this article may be
helpful:</p>

<p><a href="http://chrisolsen.org/2008/03/10/installing-git-on-ubuntu/">Article: Installing Git on Ubuntu</a></p>

<h3>Mac 10.4</h3>

<p>In both Mac 10.4 and 10.5, you can install Git via <a href="http://www.macports.org/">MacPorts</a>,
if you have that installed.  If not, you can install it from <a href="http://www.macports.org/install.php">here</a>.</p>

<p>Once MacPorts is installed, all you should have to do is:</p>

<pre><code>$ sudo port install git-core
</code></pre>

<p>If you prefer to install from source, these articles may be helpful:</p>

<p><a href="http://rails.wincent.com/wiki/Installing_Git_1.5.2.3_on_Mac_OS_X_Tiger">Article: Installing Git on Tiger</a></p>

<p><a href="http://larrytheliquid.com/2007/12/29/compiling-git-and-git-svn-on-osx-tiger/">Article: Installing Git and git-svn on Tiger from source</a></p>

<h3>Mac 10.5</h3>

<p>With Leopard, you can also install via MacPorts, but here you have the
additional option of using a nice installer, which you can download from here:
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/git-osx-installer/downloads/list?can=3">Git OSX
Installer</a></p>

<p>If you prefer to install it from source, these guides may be particularly helpful to you :</p>

<p><a href="http://dysinger.net/2007/12/30/installing-git-on-mac-os-x-105-leopard/">Article: Installing Git on OS 10.5</a></p>

<h3>Windows</h3>

<p>On Windows, installing Git is pretty easy.  Simply download and install the
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/msysgit/downloads/list">msysGit</a> package.</p>

<p>See the <em>Git on Windows</em> chapter for a screencast demonstrating installing
and using Git on Windows.</p>

<h2>Setup and Initialization</h2>

<h3>Git Config</h3>

<p>The first thing you're going to want to do is set up your name and email
address for Git to use to sign your commits.</p>

<pre><code>$ git config --global user.name "Scott Chacon"
$ git config --global user.email "schacon@gmail.com"
</code></pre>

<p>That will set up a file in your home directory which may be used by any of
your projects. By default that file is <em>~/.gitconfig</em> and the contents will
look like this:</p>

<pre><code>[user]
        name = Scott Chacon
        email = schacon@gmail.com
</code></pre>

<p>If you want to override those values for a specific project (to use a work
email address, for example), you can run the <em>git config</em> command without the
<em>--global</em> option while in that project. This will add a [user] section like
the one shown above to the <em>.git/config</em> file in your project's root
directory.</p>

<h1>Basic Usage</h1>

<h2>Getting a Git Repository</h2>

<p>So now that we're all set up, we need a Git repository. We can do this one of
two ways - we can <em>clone</em> one that already exists, or we can <em>initialize</em> one
either from existing files that aren't in source control yet, or from an empty
directory.</p>

<h3>Cloning a Repository</h3>

<p>In order to get a copy of a project, you will need to know the project's Git
URL - the location of the repository. Git can operate over many different
protocols, so it may begin with ssh://, http(s)://, git://, or just a username
(in which case git will assume ssh). Some repositories may be accessed over
more than one protocol. For example, the source code to Git itself can be
cloned either over the git:// protocol:</p>

<pre><code>git clone git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git
</code></pre>

<p>or over http:</p>

<pre><code>git clone http://www.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git
</code></pre>

<p>The git:// protocol is faster and more efficient, but sometimes it is
necessary to use http when behind corporate firewalls or what have you. In
either case you should then have a new directory named 'git' that contains all
the Git source code and history - it is basically a complete copy of what was
on the server.</p>

<p>By default, Git will name the new directory it has checked out your cloned
code into after whatever comes directly before the '.git' in the path of the
cloned project. (ie. <em>git clone
http://git.kernel.org/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git</em> will result in
a new directory named 'linux-2.6')</p>

<h3>Initializing a New Repository</h3>

<p>Assume you have a tarball named project.tar.gz with your initial work. You can
place it under git revision control as follows.</p>

<pre><code>$ tar xzf project.tar.gz
$ cd project
$ git init
</code></pre>

<p>Git will reply</p>

<pre><code>Initialized empty Git repository in .git/
</code></pre>

<p>You've now initialized the working directory--you may notice a new
directory created, named ".git".</p>

<p><a href="GitCast%20#1%20-%20setup,%20init%20and%20cloning">gitcast:c1_init</a></p>

<h2>Normal Workflow</h2>

<p>Modify some files, then add their updated contents to the index:</p>

<pre><code>$ git add file1 file2 file3
</code></pre>

<p>You are now ready to commit.  You can see what is about to be committed
using <a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-diff.html">git diff</a> with the --cached option:</p>

<pre><code>$ git diff --cached
</code></pre>

<p>(Without --cached, <a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-diff.html">git diff</a> will show you any changes that
you've made but not yet added to the index.)  You can also get a brief
summary of the situation with <a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-status.html">git status</a>:</p>

<pre><code>$ git status
# On branch master
# Changes to be committed:
#   (use "git reset HEAD &lt;file&gt;..." to unstage)
#
#   modified:   file1
#   modified:   file2
#   modified:   file3
#
</code></pre>

<p>If you need to make any further adjustments, do so now, and then add any
newly modified content to the index.  Finally, commit your changes with:</p>

<pre><code>$ git commit
</code></pre>

<p>This will again prompt you for a message describing the change, and then
record a new version of the project.</p>

<p>Alternatively, instead of running <code>git add</code> beforehand, you can use</p>

<pre><code>$ git commit -a
</code></pre>

<p>which will automatically notice any modified (but not new) files, add
them to the index, and commit, all in one step.</p>

<p>A note on commit messages: Though not required, it's a good idea to
begin the commit message with a single short (less than 50 character)
line summarizing the change, followed by a blank line and then a more
thorough description.  Tools that turn commits into email, for
example, use the first line on the Subject: line and the rest of the
commit message in the body.</p>

<h4>Git tracks content not files</h4>

<p>Many revision control systems provide an "add" command that tells the
system to start tracking changes to a new file.  Git's "add" command
does something simpler and more powerful: <code>git add</code> is used both for new
and newly modified files, and in both cases it takes a snapshot of the
given files and stages that content in the index, ready for inclusion in
the next commit.</p>

<p><a href="" title="GitCast #2: Normal Workflow">gitcast:c2_normal_workflow</a></p>

<h2>Basic Branching and Merging</h2>

<p>A single git repository can maintain multiple branches of
development.  To create a new branch named "experimental", use</p>

<pre><code>$ git branch experimental
</code></pre>

<p>If you now run</p>

<pre><code>$ git branch
</code></pre>

<p>you'll get a list of all existing branches:</p>

<pre><code>  experimental
* master
</code></pre>

<p>The "experimental" branch is the one you just created, and the
"master" branch is a default branch that was created for you
automatically.  The asterisk marks the branch you are currently on;
type</p>

<pre><code>$ git checkout experimental
</code></pre>

<p>to switch to the experimental branch.  Now edit a file, commit the
change, and switch back to the master branch:</p>

<pre><code>(edit file)
$ git commit -a
$ git checkout master
</code></pre>

<p>Check that the change you made is no longer visible, since it was
made on the experimental branch and you're back on the master branch.</p>

<p>You can make a different change on the master branch:</p>

<pre><code>(edit file)
$ git commit -a
</code></pre>

<p>at this point the two branches have diverged, with different changes
made in each.  To merge the changes made in experimental into master, run</p>

<pre><code>$ git merge experimental
</code></pre>

<p>If the changes don't conflict, you're done.  If there are conflicts,
markers will be left in the problematic files showing the conflict;</p>

<pre><code>$ git diff
</code></pre>

<p>will show this.  Once you've edited the files to resolve the
conflicts,</p>

<pre><code>$ git commit -a
</code></pre>

<p>will commit the result of the merge. Finally,</p>

<pre><code>$ gitk
</code></pre>

<p>will show a nice graphical representation of the resulting history.</p>

<p>At this point you could delete the experimental branch with</p>

<pre><code>$ git branch -d experimental
</code></pre>

<p>This command ensures that the changes in the experimental branch are
already in the current branch.</p>

<p>If you develop on a branch crazy-idea, then regret it, you can always
delete the branch with</p>

<pre><code>$ git branch -D crazy-idea
</code></pre>

<p>Branches are cheap and easy, so this is a good way to try something
out.</p>

<h3>How to merge</h3>

<p>You can rejoin two diverging branches of development using
<a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-merge.html">git merge</a>:</p>

<pre><code>$ git merge branchname
</code></pre>

<p>merges the changes made in the branch "branchname" into the current
branch.  If there are conflicts--for example, if the same file is
modified in two different ways in the remote branch and the local
branch--then you are warned; the output may look something like this:</p>

<pre><code>$ git merge next
 100% (4/4) done
Auto-merged file.txt
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in file.txt
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.
</code></pre>

<p>Conflict markers are left in the problematic files, and after
you resolve the conflicts manually, you can update the index
with the contents and run git commit, as you normally would when
modifying a file.</p>

<p>If you examine the resulting commit using gitk, you will see that it
has two parents: one pointing to the top of the current branch, and
one to the top of the other branch.</p>

<h3>Resolving a merge</h3>

<p>When a merge isn't resolved automatically, git leaves the index and
the working tree in a special state that gives you all the
information you need to help resolve the merge.</p>

<p>Files with conflicts are marked specially in the index, so until you
resolve the problem and update the index, <a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-commit.html">git commit</a> will
fail:</p>

<pre><code>$ git commit
file.txt: needs merge
</code></pre>

<p>Also, <a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-status.html">git status</a> will list those files as "unmerged", and the
files with conflicts will have conflict markers added, like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; HEAD:file.txt
Hello world
=======
Goodbye
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 77976da35a11db4580b80ae27e8d65caf5208086:file.txt
</code></pre>

<p>All you need to do is edit the files to resolve the conflicts, and then</p>

<pre><code>$ git add file.txt
$ git commit
</code></pre>

<p>Note that the commit message will already be filled in for you with
some information about the merge.  Normally you can just use this
default message unchanged, but you may add additional commentary of
your own if desired.</p>

<p>The above is all you need to know to resolve a simple merge.  But git
also provides more information to help resolve conflicts:</p>

<h3>Undoing a merge</h3>

<p>If you get stuck and decide to just give up and throw the whole mess
away, you can always return to the pre-merge state with</p>

<pre><code>$ git reset --hard HEAD
</code></pre>

<p>Or, if you've already committed the merge that you want to throw away,</p>

<pre><code>$ git reset --hard ORIG_HEAD
</code></pre>

<p>However, this last command can be dangerous in some cases--never throw away a
commit if that commit may itself have been merged into another branch, as
doing so may confuse further merges.</p>

<h3>Fast-forward merges</h3>

<p>There is one special case not mentioned above, which is treated differently.
Normally, a merge results in a merge commit with two parents, one for each of
the two lines of development that were merged.</p>

<p>However, if the current branch has not diverged from the other--so every
commit present in the current branch is already contained in the other--then
git just performs a "fast forward"; the head of the current branch is moved
forward to point at the head of the merged-in branch, without any new commits
being created.</p>

<p><a href="" title="GitCast #6: Branching and Merging">gitcast:c6-branch-merge</a></p>

<h2>Reviewing History - Git Log</h2>

<p>The <a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-log.html">git log</a> command can show lists of commits.  On its
own, it shows all commits reachable from the parent commit; but you
can also make more specific requests:</p>

<pre><code>$ git log v2.5..        # commits since (not reachable from) v2.5
$ git log test..master  # commits reachable from master but not test
$ git log master..test  # commits reachable from test but not master
$ git log master...test # commits reachable from either test or
                        #    master, but not both
$ git log --since="2 weeks ago" # commits from the last 2 weeks
$ git log Makefile      # commits that modify Makefile
$ git log fs/           # commits that modify any file under fs/
$ git log -S'foo()'     # commits that add or remove any file data
                        # matching the string 'foo()'
$ git log --no-merges   # dont show merge commits
</code></pre>

<p>And of course you can combine all of these; the following finds
commits since v2.5 which touch the Makefile or any file under fs:</p>

<pre><code>$ git log v2.5.. Makefile fs/
</code></pre>

<p>Git log will show a listing of each commit, with the most recent commits
first, that match the arguments given to the log command.</p>

<h3>Formatting the Log</h3>

<p>You can also format the log output almost however you want.  The '--pretty'
option can take a number of preset formats, such as 'oneline':</p>

<pre><code>$ git log --pretty=oneline

<p>or you can do 'short' format:</p>

<pre><code>$ git log --pretty=short

    Add diff-lcs dependency
</code></pre>

<p>You can also use 'medium', 'full', 'fuller', 'email' or 'raw'.  If those formats
aren't exactly what you need, you can also create your own format with the
'--pretty=format' option (see the <a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-log.html">git log</a> docs for all the formatting options).</p>

<pre><code>$ git log --pretty=format:'%h was %an, %ar, message: %s'

</code></pre>

<p>Another interesting thing you can do is visualize the commit graph with the
'--graph' option, like so:</p>

<pre><code>$ git log --pretty=format:'%h : %s' --graph
* 2d3acf9 : ignore errors from SIGCHLD on trap
*   5e3ee11 : Merge branch 'master' of git://github.com/dustin/grit
|\  
| * 420eac9 : Added a method for getting the current branch.
* | 30e367c : timeout code and tests
* | 5a09431 : add timeout protection to grit
* | e1193f8 : support for heads with slashes in them
|/  
* d6016bc : require time for xmlschema
</code></pre>

<p>It will give a pretty nice ASCII representation of the commit history lines.</p>

<h3>Ordering the Log</h3>

<p>You can also view the log entries in a few different orders.
Note that git log starts with the most recent commit and works
backwards through the parents; however, since git history can contain
multiple independent lines of development, the particular order that
commits are listed in may be somewhat arbitrary.</p>

<p>If you want to specify a certain order, you can add an ordering option
to the git log command.</p>

<p>By default, the commits are shown in reverse chronological order.</p>

<p>However, you can also specify '--topo-order', which makes the commits
appear in topological order (i.e. descendant commits are shown before their parents).
If we view the git log for the Grit repo in topo-order, you can see that the
development lines are all grouped together.</p>

<pre><code>$ git log --pretty=format:'%h : %s' --topo-order --graph
*   4a904d7 : Merge branch 'idx2'
|\  
| *   dfeffce : merged in bryces changes and fixed some testing issues

| | | * | 0a7d387 : Removed debug print.
| | | * | 4d6b69c : Fixed to close opened file description.
</code></pre>

<p>You can also use '--date-order', which orders the commits primarily by commit date.
This option is similar to --topo-order in the sense that no parent comes before all of its children,
but otherwise things are still ordered in the commit timestamp order. You can
see that development lines are not grouped together here, that they jump around
as parallel development occurred:</p>

<pre><code>$ git log --pretty=format:'%h : %s' --date-order --graph
*   4a904d7 : Merge branch 'idx2'
|\  
* | 81a3e0d : updated packfile code to recognize index v2

</code></pre>

<p>Lastly, you can reverse the order of the log with the '--reverse' option.</p>

<p><a href="" title="GitCast #4: Git Log">gitcast:c4-git-log</a></p>

<h2>Comparing Commits - Git Diff</h2>

<p>You can generate diffs between any two versions of your project using
<a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-diff.html">git diff</a>:</p>

<pre><code>$ git diff master..test
</code></pre>

<p>That will produce the diff between the tips of the two branches.  If
you'd prefer to find the diff from their common ancestor to test, you
can use three dots instead of two:</p>

<pre><code>$ git diff master...test
</code></pre>

<p><a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-diff.html">git diff</a> is an incredibly useful tool for figuring out what has
changed between any two points in your project's history, or to see what
people are trying to introduce in new branches, etc.</p>

<h3>What you will commit</h3>

<p>You will commonly use <a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-diff.html">git diff</a> for figuring out differences between
your last commit, your index, and your current working directory.
A common use is to simply run</p>

<pre><code>$ git diff
</code></pre>

<p>which will show you changes in the working directory that are not yet
staged for the next commit.
If you want to see what <em>is</em> staged for the next commit, you can run</p>

<pre><code>$ git diff --cached
</code></pre>

<p>which will show you the difference between the index and your last commit;
what you would be committing if you run "git commit" without the "-a" option.
Lastly, you can run</p>

<pre><code>$ git diff HEAD
</code></pre>

<p>which shows changes in the working directory since your last commit;
what you would be committing if you run "git commit -a".</p>

<h3>More Diff Options</h3>

<p>If you want to see how your current working directory differs from the state of
the project in another branch, you can run something like</p>

<pre><code>$ git diff test
</code></pre>

<p>This will show you what is different between your current working directory
and the snapshot on the 'test' branch.  You can also limit the comparison to a
specific file or subdirectory by adding a <em>path limiter</em>:</p>

<pre><code>$ git diff HEAD -- ./lib 
</code></pre>

<p>That command will show the changes between your current working directory and
the last commit (or, more accurately, the tip of the current branch), limiting
the comparison to files in the 'lib' subdirectory.</p>

<p>If you don't want to see the whole patch, you can add the '--stat' option,
which will limit the output to the files that have changed along with a little
text graph depicting how many lines changed in each file.</p>

<p>Sometimes that makes it easier to see overall what has changed, to jog your memory.</p>

<h2>Distributed Workflows</h2>

<p>Suppose that Alice has started a new project with a git repository in
/home/alice/project, and that Bob, who has a home directory on the
same machine, wants to contribute.</p>

<p>Bob begins with:</p>

<pre><code>$ git clone /home/alice/project myrepo
</code></pre>

<p>This creates a new directory "myrepo" containing a clone of Alice's
repository.  The clone is on an equal footing with the original
project, possessing its own copy of the original project's history.</p>

<p>Bob then makes some changes and commits them:</p>

<pre><code>(edit files)
$ git commit -a
(repeat as necessary)
</code></pre>

<p>When he's ready, he tells Alice to pull changes from the repository
at /home/bob/myrepo.  She does this with:</p>

<pre><code>$ cd /home/alice/project
$ git pull /home/bob/myrepo master
</code></pre>

<p>This merges the changes from Bob's "master" branch into Alice's
current branch.  If Alice has made her own changes in the meantime,
then she may need to manually fix any conflicts.  (Note that the
"master" argument in the above command is actually unnecessary, as it
is the default.)</p>

<p>The "pull" command thus performs two operations: it fetches changes
from a remote branch, then merges them into the current branch.</p>

<p>When you are working in a small closely knit group, it is not
unusual to interact with the same repository over and over
again.  By defining 'remote' repository shorthand, you can make
it easier:</p>

<pre><code>$ git remote add bob /home/bob/myrepo
</code></pre>

<p>With this, Alice can perform the first operation alone using the
"git fetch" command without merging them with her own branch,
using:</p>

<pre><code>$ git fetch bob
</code></pre>

<p>Unlike the longhand form, when Alice fetches from Bob using a
remote repository shorthand set up with <code>git remote</code>, what was
fetched is stored in a remote tracking branch, in this case
<code>bob/master</code>.  So after this:</p>

<pre><code>$ git log -p master..bob/master
</code></pre>

<p>shows a list of all the changes that Bob made since he branched from
Alice's master branch.</p>

<p>After examining those changes, Alice
could merge the changes into her master branch:</p>

<pre><code>$ git merge bob/master
</code></pre>

<p>This <code>merge</code> can also be done by 'pulling from her own remote
tracking branch', like this:</p>

<pre><code>$ git pull . remotes/bob/master
</code></pre>

<p>Note that git pull always merges into the current branch,
regardless of what else is given on the command line.</p>

<p>Later, Bob can update his repo with Alice's latest changes using</p>

<pre><code>$ git pull
</code></pre>

<p>Note that he doesn't need to give the path to Alice's repository;
when Bob cloned Alice's repository, git stored the location of her
repository in the repository configuration, and that location is
used for pulls:</p>

<pre><code>$ git config --get remote.origin.url
/home/alice/project
</code></pre>

<p>(The complete configuration created by git-clone is visible using
"git config -l", and the <a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-config.html">git config</a> man page
explains the meaning of each option.)</p>

<p>Git also keeps a pristine copy of Alice's master branch under the
name "origin/master":</p>

<pre><code>$ git branch -r
  origin/master
</code></pre>

<p>If Bob later decides to work from a different host, he can still
perform clones and pulls using the ssh protocol:</p>

<pre><code>$ git clone alice.org:/home/alice/project myrepo
</code></pre>

<p>Alternatively, git has a native protocol, or can use rsync or http;
see <a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-pull.html">git pull</a> for details.</p>

<p>Git can also be used in a CVS-like mode, with a central repository
that various users push changes to; see <a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-push.html">git push</a> and
<a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/gitcvs-migration.html">gitcvs-migration</a>.</p>

<h3>Public git repositories</h3>

<p>Another way to submit changes to a project is to tell the maintainer
of that project to pull the changes from your repository using
<a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-pull.html">git pull</a>.  This is a way to get
updates from the "main" repository, but it works just as well in the
other direction.</p>

<p>If you and the maintainer both have accounts on the same machine, then
you can just pull changes from each other's repositories directly;
commands that accept repository URLs as arguments will also accept a
local directory name:</p>

<pre><code>$ git clone /path/to/repository
$ git pull /path/to/other/repository
</code></pre>

<p>or an ssh URL:</p>

<pre><code>$ git clone ssh://yourhost/~you/repository
</code></pre>

<p>For projects with few developers, or for synchronizing a few private
repositories, this may be all you need.</p>

<p>However, the more common way to do this is to maintain a separate public
repository (usually on a different host) for others to pull changes
from.  This is usually more convenient, and allows you to cleanly
separate private work in progress from publicly visible work.</p>

<p>You will continue to do your day-to-day work in your personal
repository, but periodically "push" changes from your personal
repository into your public repository, allowing other developers to
pull from that repository.  So the flow of changes, in a situation
where there is one other developer with a public repository, looks
like this:</p>

<pre><code>                        you push
  your personal repo ------------------&gt; your public repo
    ^                                     |
    |                                     |
    | you pull                            | they pull
    |                                     |
    |                                     |
        |               they push             V
  their public repo &lt;------------------- their repo
</code></pre>

<h3>Pushing changes to a public repository</h3>

<p>Note that exporting via http or git allow other
maintainers to fetch your latest changes, but they do not allow write
access.  For this, you will need to update the public repository with the
latest changes created in your private repository.</p>

<p>The simplest way to do this is using <a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-push.html">git push</a> and ssh; to
update the remote branch named "master" with the latest state of your
branch named "master", run</p>

<pre><code>$ git push ssh://yourserver.com/~you/proj.git master:master
</code></pre>

<p>or just</p>

<pre><code>$ git push ssh://yourserver.com/~you/proj.git master
</code></pre>

<p>As with git-fetch, git-push will complain if this does not result in a
fast forward; see the following section for details on
handling this case.</p>

<p>Note that the target of a "push" is normally a bare repository.  You can also push to a
repository that has a checked-out working tree, but the working tree
will not be updated by the push.  This may lead to unexpected results if
the branch you push to is the currently checked-out branch!</p>

<p>As with git-fetch, you may also set up configuration options to
save typing; so, for example, after</p>

<pre><code>$ cat &gt;&gt;.git/config &lt;&lt;EOF
[remote "public-repo"]
    url = ssh://yourserver.com/~you/proj.git
EOF
</code></pre>

<p>you should be able to perform the above push with just</p>

<pre><code>$ git push public-repo master
</code></pre>

<p>See the explanations of the remote.<name>.url, branch.<name>.remote,
and remote.<name>.push options in <a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-config.html">git config</a> for
details.</p>

<h3>What to do when a push fails</h3>

<p>If a push would not result in a fast forward of the
remote branch, then it will fail with an error like:</p>

<pre><code>error: remote 'refs/heads/master' is not an ancestor of
local  'refs/heads/master'.
Maybe you are not up-to-date and need to pull first?
error: failed to push to 'ssh://yourserver.com/~you/proj.git'
</code></pre>

<p>This can happen, for example, if you:</p>

<pre><code>- use `git-reset --hard` to remove already-published commits, or
- use `git-commit --amend` to replace already-published commits, or
- use `git-rebase` to rebase any already-published commits.
</code></pre>

<p>You may force git-push to perform the update anyway by preceding the
branch name with a plus sign:</p>

<pre><code>$ git push ssh://yourserver.com/~you/proj.git +master
</code></pre>

<p>Normally whenever a branch head in a public repository is modified, it
is modified to point to a descendant of the commit that it pointed to
before.  By forcing a push in this situation, you break that convention.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, this is a common practice for people that need a simple
way to publish a work-in-progress patch series, and it is an acceptable
compromise as long as you warn other developers that this is how you
intend to manage the branch.</p>

<p>It's also possible for a push to fail in this way when other people have
the right to push to the same repository.  In that case, the correct
solution is to retry the push after first updating your work: either by a
pull, or by a fetch followed by a rebase; see the next section and
<a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/gitcvs-migration.html">gitcvs-migration</a> for more.</p>

<p><a href="" title="GitCast #8: Distributed Workflow">gitcast:c8-dist-workflow</a></p>

<h2>Git Tag</h2>

<h3>Lightweight Tags</h3>

<p>We can create a tag to refer to a particular commit by running <a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-tag.html">git tag</a>
with no arguments.</p>

<pre><code>$ git tag stable-1 1b2e1d63ff
</code></pre>

<p>After that, we can use stable-1 to refer to the commit 1b2e1d63ff.</p>

<p>This creates a "lightweight" tag, basically a branch that never moves.
If you would also like to include a comment with the tag,
and possibly sign it cryptographically, then we can create a <em>tag object</em> instead.</p>

<h3>Tag Objects</h3>

<p>If one of <strong>-a</strong>, <strong>-s</strong>, or <strong>-u <key-id></strong> is passed, the command creates a tag object,
and requires the tag message. Unless -m <msg> or -F <file> is given, an editor
is started for the user to type in the tag message.</p>

<p>When this happens, a new object is added to the Git object database and the
tag ref points to that <em>tag object</em>, rather than the commit itself. The strength
of this is that you can sign the tag, so you can verify that it is the correct
commit later.  You can create a tag object like this:</p>

<pre><code>$ git tag -a stable-1 1b2e1d63ff
</code></pre>

<p>It is actually possible to tag any object, but tagging commit objects is the
most common. (In the Linux kernel source, the first tag object
references a tree, rather than a commit)</p>

<h3>Signed Tags</h3>

<p>If you have a GPG key setup, you can create signed tags fairly easily.  First,
you will probably want to setup your key id in your <em>.git/config</em> or <em>~.gitconfig</em>
file.</p>

<pre><code>[user]
    signingkey = &lt;gpg-key-id&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>You can also set that with</p>

<pre><code>$ git config (--global) user.signingkey &lt;gpg-key-id&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Now you can create a signed tag simply by replacing the <strong>-a</strong> with a <strong>-s</strong>.</p>

<pre><code>$ git tag -s stable-1 1b2e1d63ff
</code></pre>

<p>If you don't have your GPG key in your config file, you can accomplish the same
thing this way:</p>

<pre><code>$ git tag -u &lt;gpg-key-id&gt; stable-1 1b2e1d63ff
</code></pre>

<h1>Intermediate Usage</h1>

<h2>Ignoring files</h2>

<p>A project will often generate files that you do 'not' want to track with git.
This typically includes files generated by a build process or temporary
backup files made by your editor. Of course, 'not' tracking files with git
is just a matter of 'not' calling "<code>git-add</code>" on them. But it quickly becomes
annoying to have these untracked files lying around; e.g. they make
"<code>git add .</code>" and "<code>git commit -a</code>" practically useless, and they keep
showing up in the output of "<code>git status</code>".</p>

<p>You can tell git to ignore certain files by creating a file called .gitignore
in the top level of your working directory, with contents such as:</p>

<pre><code># Lines starting with '#' are considered comments.
# Ignore any file named foo.txt.
foo.txt
# Ignore (generated) html files,
*.html
# except foo.html which is maintained by hand.
!foo.html
# Ignore objects and archives.
*.[oa]
</code></pre>

<p>See <a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/gitignore.html">gitignore</a> for a detailed explanation of the syntax.  You can
also place .gitignore files in other directories in your working tree, and they
will apply to those directories and their subdirectories.  The <code>.gitignore</code>
files can be added to your repository like any other files
(just run <code>git add .gitignore</code> and <code>git commit</code>, as usual), which is convenient when the exclude
patterns (such as patterns matching build output files) would also make sense
for other users who clone your repository.</p>

<p>If you wish the exclude patterns to affect only certain repositories
(instead of every repository for a given project), you may instead put
them in a file in your repository named .git/info/exclude, or in any file
specified by the <code>core.excludesfile</code> configuration variable.  Some git
commands can also take exclude patterns directly on the command line.
See <a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/gitignore.html">gitignore</a> for the details.</p>

<h2>Rebasing</h2>

<p>Suppose that you create a branch "mywork" on a remote-tracking branch
"origin".</p>

<pre><code>$ git checkout -b mywork origin
</code></pre>

<p><div class="center"><img src="assets/images/figure/rebase0.png"></div></p>

<p>Now you do some work, creating two new commits.</p>

<pre><code>$ vi file.txt
$ git commit
$ vi otherfile.txt
$ git commit
...
</code></pre>

<p>Meanwhile, someone else does some work creating two new commits on the origin
branch too. This means both 'origin' and 'mywork' has advanced, which means
the work has diverged.</p>

<p><div class="center"><img src="assets/images/figure/rebase1.png"></div></p>

<p>At this point, you could use "pull" to merge your changes back in;
the result would create a new merge commit, like this:</p>

<p><div class="center"><img src="assets/images/figure/rebase2.png"></div></p>

<p>However, if you prefer to keep the history in mywork a simple series of
commits without any merges, you may instead choose to use
<a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-rebase.html">git rebase</a>:</p>

<pre><code>$ git checkout mywork
$ git rebase origin
</code></pre>

<p>This will remove each of your commits from mywork, temporarily saving
them as patches (in a directory named ".git/rebase"), update mywork to
point at the latest version of origin, then apply each of the saved
patches to the new mywork.</p>

<p><div class="center"><img src="assets/images/figure/rebase3.png"></div></p>

<p>Once the ref ('mywork') is updated to point to the newly created commit
objects, your older commits will be abandoned.  They will likely be
removed if you run a pruning garbage collection. (see <a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-gc.html">git gc</a>)</p>

<p><div class="center"><img src="assets/images/figure/rebase4.png"></div></p>

<p>So now we can look at the difference in our history between running a merge
and running a rebase:</p>

<p><div class="center"><img src="assets/images/figure/rebase5.png"></div></p>

<p>In the process of the rebase, it may discover conflicts.  In that case it will stop
and allow you to fix the conflicts; after fixing conflicts, use "git-add"
to update the index with those contents, and then, instead of
running git-commit, just run</p>

<pre><code>$ git rebase --continue
</code></pre>

<p>and git will continue applying the rest of the patches.</p>

<p>At any point you may use the <code>--abort</code> option to abort this process and
return mywork to the state it had before you started the rebase:</p>

<pre><code>$ git rebase --abort
</code></pre>

<p><a href="" title="GitCast #7: Rebasing">gitcast:c7-rebase</a></p>

<h2>Interactive Rebasing</h2>

<p>You can also rebase interactively.  This is often used to re-write your
own commit objects before pusing them somewhere.  It is an easy way to
split, merge or re-order commits before sharing them with others.  You
can also use it to clean up commits you've pulled from someone when
applying them locally.</p>

<p>If you have a number of commits that you would like to somehow modify
during the rebase, you can invoke interactive mode by passing a '-i' or
'--interactive' to the 'git rebase' command.</p>

<pre><code>$ git rebase -i origin/master
</code></pre>

<p>This will invoke interactive rebase mode on all the commits you have made
since the last time you have pushed (or merged from the origin repository).</p>

<p>To see what commits those are beforehand, you can run log this way:</p>

<pre><code>$ git log github/master..
</code></pre>

<p>Once you run the 'rebase -i' command, you will be thrown into your editor
of choice with something that looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>pick fc62e55 added file_size
pick 9824bf4 fixed little thing
pick 21d80a5 added number to log
pick 76b9da6 added the apply command
pick c264051 Revert "added file_size" - not implemented correctly

# Rebase f408319..b04dc3d onto f408319
#
# Commands:
#  p, pick = use commit
#  e, edit = use commit, but stop for amending
#  s, squash = use commit, but meld into previous commit
#
# If you remove a line here THAT COMMIT WILL BE LOST.
# However, if you remove everything, the rebase will be aborted.
#
</code></pre>

<p>This means that there are 5 commits since you last pushed and it gives you
one line per commit with the following format:</p>

<pre><code>(action) (partial-sha) (short commit message)
</code></pre>

<p>Now, you can change the action (which is by default 'pick') to either 'edit'
or 'squash', or just leave it as 'pick'.  You can also reorder the commits
just by moving the lines around however you want.  Then, when you exit the
editor, git will try to apply the commits however they are now arranged and
do the action specified.</p>

<p>If 'pick' is specified, it will simply try to apply the patch and save the
commit with the same message as before.</p>

<p>If 'squash' is specified, it will combine that commit with the previous one
to create a new commit.  This will drop you into your editor again to merge
the commit messages of the two commits it is now squashing together.  So,
if you exit the editor with this:</p>

<pre><code>pick   fc62e55 added file_size
squash 9824bf4 fixed little thing
squash 21d80a5 added number to log
squash 76b9da6 added the apply command
squash c264051 Revert "added file_size" - not implemented correctly
</code></pre>

<p>Then you will have to create a single commit message from this:</p>

<pre><code># This is a combination of 5 commits.
# The first commit's message is:
added file_size

# This is the 2nd commit message:

fixed little thing

# This is the 3rd commit message:

added number to log

# This is the 4th commit message:

added the apply command

# This is the 5th commit message:

Revert "added file_size" - not implemented correctly

This reverts commit fc62e5543b195f18391886b9f663d5a7eca38e84.
</code></pre>

<p>Once you have edited that down into once commit message and exit the editor,
the commit will be saved with your new message.</p>

<p>If 'edit' is specified, it will do the same thing, but then pause before
moving on to the next one and drop you into the command line so you can
amend the commit, or change the commit contents somehow.</p>

<p>If you wanted to split a commit, for instance, you would specify 'edit' for
that commit:</p>

<pre><code>pick   fc62e55 added file_size
pick   9824bf4 fixed little thing
edit   21d80a5 added number to log
pick   76b9da6 added the apply command
pick   c264051 Revert "added file_size" - not implemented correctly
</code></pre>

<p>And then when you get to the command line, you revert that commit and create
two (or more) new ones.  Lets say 21d80a5 modified two files, file1 and file2,
and you wanted to split them into seperate commits.  You could do this after
the rebase dropped you to the command line :</p>

<pre><code>$ git reset HEAD^
$ git add file1
$ git commit 'first part of split commit'
$ git add file2
$ git commit 'second part of split commit'
$ git rebase --continue
</code></pre>

<p>And now instead of 5 commits, you would have 6.</p>

<p>The last useful thing that interactive rebase can do is drop commits for you.
If instead of choosing 'pick', 'squash' or 'edit' for the commit line, you
simply remove the line, it will remove the commit from the history.</p>

<h2>Interactive Adding</h2>

<p>Interactive Adding is a really nice way of working with and visualizing
the Git index.  To start it up, simply type 'git add -i'.  Git will show
you all the modified files you have and their status.</p>

<pre><code>$&gt;git add -i
           staged     unstaged path
  1:    unchanged        +4/-0 assets/stylesheets/style.css
  2:    unchanged      +23/-11 layout/book_index_template.html
  3:    unchanged        +7/-7 layout/chapter_template.html
  4:    unchanged        +3/-3 script/pdf.rb
  5:    unchanged      +121/-0 text/14_Interactive_Rebasing/0_ Interactive_Rebasing.markdown

*** Commands ***
  1: status   2: update   3: revert   4: add untracked
  5: patch    6: diff     7: quit     8: help
What now&gt; 
</code></pre>

<p>In this case, we can see that there are 5 modified files that have not been
added to our index yet (unstaged), and even how many lines have been added to
or removed from each.  It then shows us an interactive menu of what we can
do in this mode.</p>

<p>If we want to stage the files, we can type '2' or 'u' for the update mode.
Then I can specify which files I want to stage (add to the index) by typing
in the numbers of the files (in this case, 1-4)</p>

<pre><code>What now&gt; 2
           staged     unstaged path
  1:    unchanged        +4/-0 assets/stylesheets/style.css
  2:    unchanged      +23/-11 layout/book_index_template.html
  3:    unchanged        +7/-7 layout/chapter_template.html
  4:    unchanged        +3/-3 script/pdf.rb
  5:    unchanged      +121/-0 text/14_Interactive_Rebasing/0_ Interactive_Rebasing.markdown
Update&gt;&gt; 1-4
           staged     unstaged path
* 1:    unchanged        +4/-0 assets/stylesheets/style.css
* 2:    unchanged      +23/-11 layout/book_index_template.html
* 3:    unchanged        +7/-7 layout/chapter_template.html
* 4:    unchanged        +3/-3 script/pdf.rb
  5:    unchanged      +121/-0 text/14_Interactive_Rebasing/0_ Interactive_Rebasing.markdown
Update&gt;&gt; 
</code></pre>

<p>If I hit enter, I will be taken back to the main menu where I can see that
the file status has changed:</p>

<pre><code>What now&gt; status
           staged     unstaged path
  1:        +4/-0      nothing assets/stylesheets/style.css
  2:      +23/-11      nothing layout/book_index_template.html
  3:        +7/-7      nothing layout/chapter_template.html
  4:        +3/-3      nothing script/pdf.rb
  5:    unchanged      +121/-0 text/14_Interactive_Rebasing/0_ Interactive_Rebasing.markdown
</code></pre>

<p>Now we can see the first four files are staged and the last one is still not.
This is basically a compressed way to see the same information we see when
we run 'git status' from the command line:</p>

<pre><code>$ git status
# On branch master
# Changes to be committed:
#   (use "git reset HEAD &lt;file&gt;..." to unstage)
#
#   modified:   assets/stylesheets/style.css
#   modified:   layout/book_index_template.html
#   modified:   layout/chapter_template.html
#   modified:   script/pdf.rb
#
# Changed but not updated:
#   (use "git add &lt;file&gt;..." to update what will be committed)
#
#   modified:   text/14_Interactive_Rebasing/0_ Interactive_Rebasing.markdown
#
</code></pre>

<p>There are a number of useful things we can do, including unstaging files (3: revert),
adding untracked files (4: add untracked), and viewing diffs (6: diff). Those
are all pretty straightforward.  However, there is one command that is pretty
cool here, which is staging patches (5: patch).</p>

<p>If you type '5' or 'p' in the menu, git will show you your diff patch by patch
(or hunk by hunk) and ask if you want to stage each one.  That way you can
actually stage for a commit a part of a file edit.  If you've edited a file
and want to only commit part of it and not an unfinished part, or commit
documentation or whitespace changes seperate from substantive changes, you can
use 'git add -i' to do so relatively easily.</p>

<p>Here I've staged some changes to the book_index_template.html file, but not all
of them:</p>

<pre><code>         staged     unstaged path
1:        +4/-0      nothing assets/stylesheets/style.css
2:       +20/-7        +3/-4 layout/book_index_template.html

</code></pre>

<p>When you are done making changes to your index through 'git add -i', you simply
quit (7: quit) and then run 'git commit' to commit the staged changes.  Remember
<strong>not</strong> to run 'git commit -a', which will blow away all the careful changes
you've just made and simply commit everything.</p>

<p><a href="" title="GitCast #3: Interactive Adding">gitcast:c3_add_interactive</a></p>

<h2>Stashing</h2>

<p>While you are in the middle of working on something complicated, you
find an unrelated but obvious and trivial bug.  You would like to fix it
before continuing.  You can use <a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-stash.html">git stash</a> to save the current
state of your work, and after fixing the bug (or, optionally after doing
so on a different branch and then coming back), unstash the
work-in-progress changes.</p>

<pre><code>$ git stash "work in progress for foo feature"
</code></pre>

<p>This command will save your changes away to the <code>stash</code>, and
reset your working tree and the index to match the tip of your
current branch.  Then you can make your fix as usual.</p>

<pre><code>... edit and test ...
$ git commit -a -m "blorpl: typofix"
</code></pre>

<p>After that, you can go back to what you were working on with
<code>git stash apply</code>:</p>

<pre><code>$ git stash apply
</code></pre>

<h3>Stash Queue</h3>

<p>You can also use stashing to queue up stashed changes.<br/>
If you run 'git stash list' you can see which stashes you have saved:</p>

<pre><code>$&gt;git stash list
stash@{0}: WIP on book: 51bea1d... fixed images
stash@{1}: WIP on master: 9705ae6... changed the browse code to the official repo
</code></pre>

<p>Then you can apply them individually with 'git stash apply stash@{1}'.  You
can clear out the list with 'git stash clear'.</p>

<h2>Git Treeishes</h2>

<p>There are a number of ways to refer to a particular commit or tree other
than spelling out the entire 40-character sha.  In Git, these are referred
to as a 'treeish'.</p>

<h3>Partial Sha</h3>

<p>If your commit sha is '<code>980e3ccdaac54a0d4de358f3fe5d718027d96aae</code>', git will
recognize any of the following identically:</p>

<pre><code>980e3ccdaac54a0d4de358f3fe5d718027d96aae
980e3ccdaac54a0d4
980e3cc
</code></pre>

<p>As long as the partial sha is unique - it can't be confused with another
(which is incredibly unlikely if you use at least 5 characters), git will
expand a partial sha for you.</p>

<h3>Branch, Remote or Tag Name</h3>

<p>You can always use a branch, remote or tag name instead of a sha, since they
are simply pointers anyhow.  If your master branch is on the 980e3 commit and
you've pushed it to origin and have tagged it 'v1.0', then all of the following
are equivalent:</p>

<pre><code>980e3ccdaac54a0d4de358f3fe5d718027d96aae
origin/master
refs/remotes/origin/master
master
refs/heads/master
v1.0
refs/tags/v1.0
</code></pre>

<p>Which means the following will give you identical output:</p>

<pre><code>$ git log master

$ git log refs/tags/v1.0
</code></pre>

<h3>Date Spec</h3>

<p>The Ref Log that git keeps will allow you to do some relative stuff locally,
such as:</p>

<pre><code>master@{yesterday}

master@{1 month ago}
</code></pre>

<p>Which is shorthand for 'where the master branch head was yesterday', etc. Note
that this format can result in different shas on different computers, even if
the master branch is currently pointing to the same place.</p>

<h3>Ordinal Spec</h3>

<p>This format will give you the Nth previous value of a particular reference.
For example:</p>

<pre><code>master@{5}
</code></pre>

<p>will give you the 5th prior value of the master head ref.</p>

<h3>Carrot Parent</h3>

<p>This will give you the Nth parent of a particular commit.  This format is only
useful on merge commits - commit objects that have more than one direct parent.</p>

<pre><code>master^2
</code></pre>

<h3>Tilde Spec</h3>

<p>The tilde spec will give you the Nth grandparent of a commit object.  For example,</p>

<pre><code>master~2
</code></pre>

<p>will give us the first parent of the first parent of the commit that master
points to.  It is equivalent to:</p>

<pre><code>master^^
</code></pre>

<p>You can keep doing this, too.  The following specs will point to the same commit:</p>

<pre><code>master^^^^^^
master~3^~2
master~6
</code></pre>

<h3>Tree Pointer</h3>

<p>This disambiguates a commit from the tree that it points to.  If you want the
sha that a commit points to, you can add the '<sup>{tree}'</sup> spec to the end of it.</p>

<pre><code>master^{tree}
</code></pre>

<h3>Blob Spec</h3>

<p>If you want the sha of a particular blob, you can add the blob path at the
end of the treeish, like so:</p>

<pre><code>master:/path/to/file
</code></pre>

<h3>Range</h3>

<p>Finally, you can specify a range of commits with the range spec.  This will
give you all the commits between 7b593b5 and 51bea1 (where 51bea1 is most recent),
excluding 7b593b5 but including 51bea1:</p>

<pre><code>7b593b5..51bea1
</code></pre>

<p>This will include every commit <em>since</em> 7b593b:</p>

<pre><code>7b593b.. 
</code></pre>

<h2>Tracking Branches</h2>

<p>A 'tracking branch' in Git is a local branch that is connected to a remote
branch.  When you push and pull on that branch, it automatically pushes and
pulls to the remote branch that it is connected with.</p>

<p>Use this if you always pull from the same upstream branch into the new
branch, and if you don't want to use "git pull <repository> <refspec>"
explicitly.</p>

<p>The 'git clone' command automatically sets up a 'master' branch that is
a tracking branch for 'origin/master' - the master branch on the cloned
repository.</p>

<p>You can create a tracking branch manually by adding the '--track' option
to the 'branch' command in Git.</p>

<pre><code>git branch --track experimental origin/experimental
</code></pre>

<p>Then when you run:</p>

<pre><code>$ git pull experimental
</code></pre>

<p>It will automatically fetch from 'origin' and merge 'origin/experimental'
into your local 'experimental' branch.</p>

<p>Likewise, when you push to origin, it will push what your 'experimental' points to
to origins 'experimental', without having to specify it.</p>

<h2>Finding with Git Grep</h2>

<p>Finding files with words or phrases in Git is really easy with the
<a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-grep.html">git grep</a> command.  It is possible to do this with the normal
unix 'grep' command, but with 'git grep' you can also search through
previous versions of the project without having to check them out.</p>

<p>For example, if I wanted to see every place that used the 'xmmap' call in
my git.git repository, I could run this:</p>

<pre><code>$ git grep xmmap
config.c:               contents = xmmap(NULL, contents_sz, PROT_READ,
diff.c:         s-&gt;data = xmmap(NULL, s-&gt;size, PROT_READ, MAP_PRIVATE, fd, 0);
git-compat-util.h:extern void *xmmap(void *start, size_t length, int prot, int fla
read-cache.c:   mmap = xmmap(NULL, mmap_size, PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE, MAP_PRIVATE,
refs.c: log_mapped = xmmap(NULL, mapsz, PROT_READ, MAP_PRIVATE, logfd, 0);
sha1_file.c:    map = xmmap(NULL, mapsz, PROT_READ, MAP_PRIVATE, fd, 0);
sha1_file.c:    idx_map = xmmap(NULL, idx_size, PROT_READ, MAP_PRIVATE, fd, 0);
sha1_file.c:                    win-&gt;base = xmmap(NULL, win-&gt;len,
sha1_file.c:                    map = xmmap(NULL, *size, PROT_READ, MAP_PRIVATE, f
sha1_file.c:            buf = xmmap(NULL, size, PROT_READ, MAP_PRIVATE, fd, 0);
wrapper.c:void *xmmap(void *start, size_t length,
</code></pre>

<p>If I wanted to see the line number of each match as well, I can add the '-n'
option:</p>

<pre><code>$&gt;git grep -n xmmap
config.c:1016:          contents = xmmap(NULL, contents_sz, PROT_READ,
diff.c:1833:            s-&gt;data = xmmap(NULL, s-&gt;size, PROT_READ, MAP_PRIVATE, fd,
git-compat-util.h:291:extern void *xmmap(void *start, size_t length, int prot, int
read-cache.c:1178:      mmap = xmmap(NULL, mmap_size, PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE, MAP_
refs.c:1345:    log_mapped = xmmap(NULL, mapsz, PROT_READ, MAP_PRIVATE, logfd, 0);
sha1_file.c:377:        map = xmmap(NULL, mapsz, PROT_READ, MAP_PRIVATE, fd, 0);
sha1_file.c:479:        idx_map = xmmap(NULL, idx_size, PROT_READ, MAP_PRIVATE, fd
sha1_file.c:780:                        win-&gt;base = xmmap(NULL, win-&gt;len,
sha1_file.c:1076:                       map = xmmap(NULL, *size, PROT_READ, MAP_PR
sha1_file.c:2393:               buf = xmmap(NULL, size, PROT_READ, MAP_PRIVATE, fd
wrapper.c:89:void *xmmap(void *start, size_t length,
</code></pre>

<p>If we're only interested in the filename, we can pass the '--name-only' option:</p>

<pre><code>$&gt;git grep --name-only xmmap
config.c
diff.c
git-compat-util.h
read-cache.c
refs.c
sha1_file.c
wrapper.c
</code></pre>

<p>We could also see how many line matches we have in each file with the '-c'
option:</p>

<pre><code>$&gt;git grep -c xmmap
config.c:1
diff.c:1
git-compat-util.h:1
read-cache.c:1
refs.c:1
sha1_file.c:5
wrapper.c:1
</code></pre>

<p>Now, if I wanted to see where that was used in a specific version of git, I
could add the tag reference to the end, like this:</p>

<pre><code>$ git grep xmmap v1.5.0
v1.5.0:config.c:                contents = xmmap(NULL, st.st_size, PROT_READ,
v1.5.0:diff.c:          s-&gt;data = xmmap(NULL, s-&gt;size, PROT_READ, MAP_PRIVATE, fd,
v1.5.0:git-compat-util.h:static inline void *xmmap(void *start, size_t length,
v1.5.0:read-cache.c:                    cache_mmap = xmmap(NULL, cache_mmap_size, 
v1.5.0:refs.c:  log_mapped = xmmap(NULL, st.st_size, PROT_READ, MAP_PRIVATE, logfd
v1.5.0:sha1_file.c:     map = xmmap(NULL, st.st_size, PROT_READ, MAP_PRIVATE, fd, 
v1.5.0:sha1_file.c:     idx_map = xmmap(NULL, idx_size, PROT_READ, MAP_PRIVATE, fd
v1.5.0:sha1_file.c:                     win-&gt;base = xmmap(NULL, win-&gt;len,
v1.5.0:sha1_file.c:     map = xmmap(NULL, st.st_size, PROT_READ, MAP_PRIVATE, fd, 
v1.5.0:sha1_file.c:             buf = xmmap(NULL, size, PROT_READ, MAP_PRIVATE, fd
</code></pre>

<p>We can see that there are some differences between the current lines and these
lines in version 1.5.0, one of which is that xmmap is now used in wrapper.c where
it was not back in v1.5.0.</p>

<p>We can also combine search terms in grep.  Say we wanted to search for where
SORT_DIRENT is defined in our repository:</p>

<pre><code>$ git grep -e '#define' --and -e SORT_DIRENT
builtin-fsck.c:#define SORT_DIRENT 0
builtin-fsck.c:#define SORT_DIRENT 1
</code></pre>

<p>We can also search for every file that has <em>both</em> search terms, but display
each line that has <em>either</em> of the terms in those files:</p>

<pre><code>$ git grep --all-match -e '#define' -e SORT_DIRENT
builtin-fsck.c:#define REACHABLE 0x0001
builtin-fsck.c:#define SEEN      0x0002
builtin-fsck.c:#define ERROR_OBJECT 01
builtin-fsck.c:#define ERROR_REACHABLE 02
builtin-fsck.c:#define SORT_DIRENT 0
builtin-fsck.c:#define DIRENT_SORT_HINT(de) 0
builtin-fsck.c:#define SORT_DIRENT 1
builtin-fsck.c:#define DIRENT_SORT_HINT(de) ((de)-&gt;d_ino)
builtin-fsck.c:#define MAX_SHA1_ENTRIES (1024)
builtin-fsck.c: if (SORT_DIRENT)
</code></pre>

<p>We can also search for lines that have one term and either of two other terms,
for example, if we wanted to see where we defined constants that had either
PATH or MAX in the name:</p>

<pre><code>$ git grep -e '#define' --and \( -e PATH -e MAX \) 
abspath.c:#define MAXDEPTH 5
builtin-blame.c:#define MORE_THAN_ONE_PATH      (1u&lt;&lt;13)
builtin-blame.c:#define MAXSG 16
builtin-describe.c:#define MAX_TAGS     (FLAG_BITS - 1)
builtin-fetch-pack.c:#define MAX_IN_VAIN 256
builtin-fsck.c:#define MAX_SHA1_ENTRIES (1024)
...
</code></pre>

<h2>Undoing in Git - Reset, Checkout and Revert</h2>

<p>Git provides multiple methods for fixing up mistakes as you
are developing.  Selecting an appropriate method depends on whether
or not you have committed the mistake, and if you have committed the
mistake, whether you have shared the erroneous commit with anyone else.</p>

<h3>Fixing un-committed mistakes</h3>

<p>If you've messed up the working tree, but haven't yet committed your
mistake, you can return the entire working tree to the last committed
state with</p>

<pre><code>$ git reset --hard HEAD
</code></pre>

<p>This will throw away any changes you may have added to the git index
and as well as any outstanding changes you have in your working tree.
In other words, it causes the results of "git diff" and "git diff --cached"
to both be empty.</p>

<p>If you just want to restore just one file, say your hello.rb, use
<a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-checkout.html">git checkout</a> instead</p>

<pre><code>$ git checkout -- hello.rb
$ git checkout HEAD hello.rb
</code></pre>

<p>The first command restores hello.rb to the version in the index,
so that "git diff hello.rb" returns no differences.  The second command
will restore hello.rb to the version in the HEAD revision, so
that both "git diff hello.rb" and "git diff --cached hello.rb"
return no differences.</p>

<h3>Fixing committed mistakes</h3>

<p>If you make a commit that you later wish you hadn't, there are two
fundamentally different ways to fix the problem:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>You can create a new commit that undoes whatever was done
 by the old commit.  This is the correct thing if your
 mistake has already been made public.</p></li>
<li><p>You can go back and modify the old commit.  You should
 never do this if you have already made the history public;
 git does not normally expect the "history" of a project to
 change, and cannot correctly perform repeated merges from
 a branch that has had its history changed.</p></li>
</ol>


<h4>Fixing a mistake with a new commit</h4>

<p>Creating a new commit that reverts an earlier change is very easy;
just pass the <a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-revert.html">git revert</a> command a reference to the bad
commit; for example, to revert the most recent commit:</p>

<pre><code>$ git revert HEAD
</code></pre>

<p>This will create a new commit which undoes the change in HEAD.  You
will be given a chance to edit the commit message for the new commit.</p>

<p>You can also revert an earlier change, for example, the next-to-last:</p>

<pre><code>$ git revert HEAD^
</code></pre>

<p>In this case git will attempt to undo the old change while leaving
intact any changes made since then.  If more recent changes overlap
with the changes to be reverted, then you will be asked to fix
conflicts manually, just as in the case of resolving a merge.</p>

<h4>Fixing a mistake by modifying a commit</h4>

<p>If you have just committed something but realize you need to fix
up that commit, recent versions of <a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-commit.html">git commit</a> support an
<strong>--amend</strong> flag which instructs git to replace the HEAD commit
with a new one, based on the current contents of the index.  This
gives you an opportunity to add files that you forgot to add or
correct typos in a commit message, prior to pushing the change
out for the world to see.</p>

<p>If you find a mistake in an older commit, but still one that you
have not yet published to the world, you use <a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-rebase.html">git rebase</a>
in interactive mode, with "git rebase -i" marking the change
that requires correction with <strong>edit</strong>.  This will allow you
to amend the commit during the rebasing process.</p>

<h2>Maintaining Git</h2>

<h3>Ensuring good performance</h3>

<p>On large repositories, git depends on compression to keep the history
information from taking up too much space on disk or in memory.</p>

<p>This compression is not performed automatically.  Therefore you
should occasionally run <a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-gc.html">git gc</a>:</p>

<pre><code>$ git gc
</code></pre>

<p>to recompress the archive.  This can be very time-consuming, so
you may prefer to run git-gc when you are not doing other work.</p>

<h3>Ensuring reliability</h3>

<p>The <a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-fsck.html">git fsck</a> command runs a number of self-consistency checks
on the repository, and reports on any problems.  This may take some
time.  The most common warning by far is about "dangling" objects:</p>

<pre><code>$ git fsck
dangling commit 7281251ddd2a61e38657c827739c57015671a6b3
dangling commit 2706a059f258c6b245f298dc4ff2ccd30ec21a63
dangling commit 13472b7c4b80851a1bc551779171dcb03655e9b5
dangling blob 218761f9d90712d37a9c5e36f406f92202db07eb
dangling commit bf093535a34a4d35731aa2bd90fe6b176302f14f
dangling commit 8e4bec7f2ddaa268bef999853c25755452100f8e
dangling tree d50bb86186bf27b681d25af89d3b5b68382e4085
dangling tree b24c2473f1fd3d91352a624795be026d64c8841f
...
</code></pre>

<p>Dangling objects are not a problem.  At worst they may take up a little
extra disk space.  They can sometimes provide a last-resort method for
recovering lost work.</p>

<h2>Setting Up A Public Repository</h2>

<p>Assume your personal repository is in the directory ~/proj.  We
first create a new clone of the repository and tell git-daemon that it
is meant to be public:</p>

<pre><code>$ git clone --bare ~/proj proj.git
$ touch proj.git/git-daemon-export-ok
</code></pre>

<p>The resulting directory proj.git contains a "bare" git repository--it is
just the contents of the ".git" directory, without any files checked out
around it.</p>

<p>Next, copy proj.git to the server where you plan to host the
public repository.  You can use scp, rsync, or whatever is most
convenient.</p>

<h3>Exporting a git repository via the git protocol</h3>

<p>This is the preferred method.</p>

<p>If someone else administers the server, they should tell you what
directory to put the repository in, and what git:// URL it will appear
at.</p>

<p>Otherwise, all you need to do is start <a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-daemon.html">git daemon</a>; it will
listen on port 9418.  By default, it will allow access to any directory
that looks like a git directory and contains the magic file
git-daemon-export-ok.  Passing some directory paths as git-daemon
arguments will further restrict the exports to those paths.</p>

<p>You can also run git-daemon as an inetd service; see the
<a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-daemon.html">git daemon</a> man page for details.  (See especially the
examples section.)</p>

<h3>Exporting a git repository via http</h3>

<p>The git protocol gives better performance and reliability, but on a
host with a web server set up, http exports may be simpler to set up.</p>

<p>All you need to do is place the newly created bare git repository in
a directory that is exported by the web server, and make some
adjustments to give web clients some extra information they need:</p>

<pre><code>$ mv proj.git /home/you/public_html/proj.git
$ cd proj.git
$ git --bare update-server-info
$ chmod a+x hooks/post-update
</code></pre>

<p>(For an explanation of the last two lines, see
<a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-update-server-info.html">git update-server-info</a> and <a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/githooks.html">githooks</a>.)</p>

<p>Advertise the URL of proj.git.  Anybody else should then be able to
clone or pull from that URL, for example with a command line like:</p>

<pre><code>$ git clone http://yourserver.com/~you/proj.git
</code></pre>

<h2>Setting Up a Private Repository</h2>

<p>If you need to setup a private repository and want to do so locally,
rather than using a hosted solution, you have a number of options.</p>

<h3>Repo Access over SSH</h3>

<p>Generally, the easiest solution is to simply use Git over SSH.  If users
already have ssh accounts on a machine, you can put the git repository
anywhere on the box that they have access to and let them access it over
normal ssh logins.  For example, say you have a repository you want to
host.  You can export it as a bare repo and then scp it onto your server
like so:</p>

<pre><code>$ git clone --bare /home/user/myrepo/.git /tmp/myrepo.git
$ scp -r /tmp/myrepo.git myserver.com:/opt/git/myrepo.git
</code></pre>

<p>Then someone else with an ssh account on myserver.com can clone via:</p>

<pre><code>$ git clone myserver.com:/opt/git/myrepo.git
</code></pre>

<p>Which will simply prompt them for thier ssh password or use thier public key,
however they have ssh authentication setup.</p>

<h3>Multiple User Access using Gitosis</h3>

<p>If you don't want to setup seperate accounts for every user, you can use
a tool called Gitosis.  In gitosis, there is an authorized_keys file that
contains the public keys of everyone authorized to access the repository,
and then everyone uses the 'git' user to do pushes and pulls.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.urbanpuddle.com/articles/2008/07/11/installing-git-on-a-server-ubuntu-or-debian">Installing and Setting up Gitosis</a></p>

<h1>Advanced Git</h1>

<h2>Creating New Empty Branches</h2>

<p>Ocasionally, you may want to keep branches in your repository that do not
share an ancestor with your normal code.  Some examples of this might be
generated documentation or something along those lines.  If you want to
create a new branch head that does not use your current codebase as a
parent, you can create an empty branch like this:</p>

<pre><code>git symbolic-ref HEAD refs/heads/newbranch 
rm .git/index 
git clean -fdx 
&lt;do work&gt; 
git add your files 
git commit -m 'Initial commit'
</code></pre>

<p><a href="" title="GitCast #7: Creating Empty Branches">gitcast:c9-empty-branch</a></p>

<h2>Modifying your History</h2>

<p>Interactive rebasing is a good way to modify individual commits.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-filter-branch.html">git filter-branch</a> is a good way to edit commits en masse.</p>

<h2>Advanced Branching And Merging</h2>

<h3>Getting conflict-resolution help during a merge</h3>

<p>All of the changes that git was able to merge automatically are
already added to the index file, so <a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-diff.html">git diff</a> shows only
the conflicts.  It uses an unusual syntax:</p>

<pre><code>$ git diff
diff --cc file.txt
index 802992c,2b60207..0000000
--- a/file.txt
+++ b/file.txt
@@@ -1,1 -1,1 +1,5 @@@
++&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; HEAD:file.txt
 +Hello world
++=======
+ Goodbye
++&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 77976da35a11db4580b80ae27e8d65caf5208086:file.txt
</code></pre>

<p>Recall that the commit which will be committed after we resolve this
conflict will have two parents instead of the usual one: one parent
will be HEAD, the tip of the current branch; the other will be the
tip of the other branch, which is stored temporarily in MERGE_HEAD.</p>

<p>During the merge, the index holds three versions of each file.  Each of
these three "file stages" represents a different version of the file:</p>

<pre><code>$ git show :1:file.txt  # the file in a common ancestor of both branches
$ git show :2:file.txt  # the version from HEAD.
$ git show :3:file.txt  # the version from MERGE_HEAD.
</code></pre>

<p>When you ask <a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-diff.html">git diff</a> to show the conflicts, it runs a
three-way diff between the conflicted merge results in the work tree with
stages 2 and 3 to show only hunks whose contents come from both sides,
mixed (in other words, when a hunk's merge results come only from stage 2,
that part is not conflicting and is not shown.  Same for stage 3).</p>

<p>The diff above shows the differences between the working-tree version of
file.txt and the stage 2 and stage 3 versions.  So instead of preceding
each line by a single "+" or "-", it now uses two columns: the first
column is used for differences between the first parent and the working
directory copy, and the second for differences between the second parent
and the working directory copy.  (See the "COMBINED DIFF FORMAT" section
of <a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-diff-files.html">git diff-files</a> for a details of the format.)</p>

<p>After resolving the conflict in the obvious way (but before updating the
index), the diff will look like:</p>

<pre><code>$ git diff
diff --cc file.txt
index 802992c,2b60207..0000000
--- a/file.txt
+++ b/file.txt
@@@ -1,1 -1,1 +1,1 @@@
- Hello world
-Goodbye
++Goodbye world
</code></pre>

<p>This shows that our resolved version deleted "Hello world" from the
first parent, deleted "Goodbye" from the second parent, and added
"Goodbye world", which was previously absent from both.</p>

<p>Some special diff options allow diffing the working directory against
any of these stages:</p>

<pre><code>$ git diff -1 file.txt      # diff against stage 1
$ git diff --base file.txt  # same as the above
$ git diff -2 file.txt      # diff against stage 2
$ git diff --ours file.txt  # same as the above
$ git diff -3 file.txt      # diff against stage 3
$ git diff --theirs file.txt    # same as the above.
</code></pre>

<p>The <a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-log.html">git log</a> and <a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/gitk.html">gitk</a> commands also provide special help
for merges:</p>

<pre><code>$ git log --merge
$ gitk --merge
</code></pre>

<p>These will display all commits which exist only on HEAD or on
MERGE_HEAD, and which touch an unmerged file.</p>

<p>You may also use <a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-mergetool.html">git mergetool</a>, which lets you merge the
unmerged files using external tools such as emacs or kdiff3.</p>

<p>Each time you resolve the conflicts in a file and update the index:</p>

<pre><code>$ git add file.txt
</code></pre>

<p>the different stages of that file will be "collapsed", after which
git-diff will (by default) no longer show diffs for that file.</p>

<h3>Multiway Merge</h3>

<p>You can merge several heads at one time by simply listing them on the same
<a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-merge.html">git merge</a> command.  For instance,</p>

<pre><code>$ git merge scott/master rick/master tom/master
</code></pre>

<p>is the equivalent of:</p>

<pre><code>$ git merge scott/master
$ git merge rick/master
$ git merge tom/master
</code></pre>

<h3>Subtree</h3>

<p>There are situations where you want to include contents in your project from
an independently developed project. You can just pull from the other project
as long as there are no conflicting paths.</p>

<p>The problematic case is when there are conflicting files. Potential
candidates are Makefiles and other standard filenames. You could merge
these files but probably you do not want to. A better solution for this
problem can be to merge the project as its own subdirectory. This is not
supported by the recursive merge strategy, so just pulling won't work.</p>

<p>What you want is the subtree merge strategy, which helps you in such a situation.</p>

<p>In this example, let's say you have the repository at /path/to/B
(but it can be an URL as well, if you want). You want to merge the master
branch of that repository to the dir-B subdirectory in your current branch.</p>

<p>Here is the command sequence you need:</p>

<pre><code>$ git remote add -f Bproject /path/to/B (1)
$ git merge -s ours --no-commit Bproject/master (2)
$ git read-tree --prefix=dir-B/ -u Bproject/master (3)
$ git commit -m "Merge B project as our subdirectory" (4)
$ git pull -s subtree Bproject master (5)
</code></pre>

<p>The benefit of using subtree merge is that it requires less administrative
burden from the users of your repository. It works with older
(before Git v1.5.2) clients and you have the code right after clone.</p>

<p>However if you use submodules then you can choose not to transfer the
submodule objects. This may be a problem with the subtree merge.</p>

<p>Also, in case you make changes to the other project, it is easier to
submit changes if you just use submodules.</p>

<p>(from <a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/howto/using-merge-subtree.html">Using Subtree Merge</a>)</p>

<h2>Finding Issues - Git Bisect</h2>

<p>Suppose version 2.6.18 of your project worked, but the version at
"master" crashes.  Sometimes the best way to find the cause of such a
regression is to perform a brute-force search through the project's
history to find the particular commit that caused the problem.  The
<a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-bisect.html">git bisect</a> command can help you do this:</p>

<pre><code>$ git bisect start
$ git bisect good v2.6.18
$ git bisect bad master
Bisecting: 3537 revisions left to test after this
[65934a9a028b88e83e2b0f8b36618fe503349f8e] BLOCK: Make USB storage depend on SCSI rather than selecting it [try #6]
</code></pre>

<p>If you run "git branch" at this point, you'll see that git has
temporarily moved you to a new branch named "bisect".  This branch
points to a commit (with commit id 65934...) that is reachable from
"master" but not from v2.6.18.  Compile and test it, and see whether
it crashes.  Assume it does crash.  Then:</p>

<pre><code>$ git bisect bad
Bisecting: 1769 revisions left to test after this
[7eff82c8b1511017ae605f0c99ac275a7e21b867] i2c-core: Drop useless bitmaskings
</code></pre>

<p>checks out an older version.  Continue like this, telling git at each
stage whether the version it gives you is good or bad, and notice
that the number of revisions left to test is cut approximately in
half each time.</p>

<p>After about 13 tests (in this case), it will output the commit id of
the guilty commit.  You can then examine the commit with
<a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-show.html">git show</a>, find out who wrote it, and mail them your bug
report with the commit id.  Finally, run</p>

<pre><code>$ git bisect reset
</code></pre>

<p>to return you to the branch you were on before and delete the
temporary "bisect" branch.</p>

<p>Note that the version which git-bisect checks out for you at each
point is just a suggestion, and you're free to try a different
version if you think it would be a good idea.  For example,
occasionally you may land on a commit that broke something unrelated;
run</p>

<pre><code>$ git bisect visualize
</code></pre>

<p>which will run gitk and label the commit it chose with a marker that
says "bisect".  Choose a safe-looking commit nearby, note its commit
id, and check it out with:</p>

<pre><code>$ git reset --hard fb47ddb2db...
</code></pre>

<p>then test, run "bisect good" or "bisect bad" as appropriate, and
continue.</p>

<h2>Finding Issues - Git Blame</h2>

<p>The <a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-blame.html">git blame</a> command is really helpful for figuring out who changed
which sections of a file.  If you simple run 'git blame [filename]' you'll get
an output of the entire file with the last commit sha, date and author for every
line in the file.</p>

<pre><code>$ git blame sha1_file.c
...
0fcfd160 (Linus Torvalds  2005-04-18 13:04:43 -0700    8)  */

</code></pre>

<p>This is often helpful if a file had a line reverted or a mistake that broke
the build to help you see who changed that line last.</p>

<p>You can also specify a start and end line for the blame:</p>

<pre><code>$&gt;git blame -L 160,+10 sha1_file.c 
ace1534d (Junio C Hamano 2005-05-07 00:38:04 -0700       160)}

<h2>Git and Email</h2>

<h3>Submitting patches to a project</h3>

<p>If you just have a few changes, the simplest way to submit them may
just be to send them as patches in email:</p>

<p>First, use <a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-format-patch.html">git format-patch</a>; for example:</p>

<pre><code>$ git format-patch origin
</code></pre>

<p>will produce a numbered series of files in the current directory, one
for each patch in the current branch but not in origin/HEAD.</p>

<p>You can then import these into your mail client and send them by
hand.  However, if you have a lot to send at once, you may prefer to
use the <a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-send-email.html">git send-email</a> script to automate the process.
Consult the mailing list for your project first to determine how they
prefer such patches be handled.</p>

<h3>Importing patches to a project</h3>

<p>Git also provides a tool called <a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-am.html">git am</a> (am stands for
"apply mailbox"), for importing such an emailed series of patches.
Just save all of the patch-containing messages, in order, into a
single mailbox file, say "patches.mbox", then run</p>

<pre><code>$ git am -3 patches.mbox
</code></pre>

<p>Git will apply each patch in order; if any conflicts are found, it
will stop, and you can manually fix the conflicts and
resolve the merge.  (The "-3" option tells
git to perform a merge; if you would prefer it just to abort and
leave your tree and index untouched, you may omit that option.)</p>

<p>Once the index is updated with the results of the conflict
resolution, instead of creating a new commit, just run</p>

<pre><code>$ git am --resolved
</code></pre>

<p>and git will create the commit for you and continue applying the
remaining patches from the mailbox.</p>

<p>The final result will be a series of commits, one for each patch in
the original mailbox, with authorship and commit log message each
taken from the message containing each patch.</p>

<h2>Customizing Git</h2>

<h3>Adding Color</h3>

<p>See all color.* options in the <a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-config.html">git config</a> docs</p>

<pre><code>$ git config color.branch auto
$ git config color.diff auto
$ git config color.interactive auto
$ git config color.status auto
</code></pre>

<p>Or, you can set all of them on with the color.ui option:</p>

<pre><code>$ git config color.ui true
</code></pre>

<h3>Commit Template</h3>

<pre><code>$ git config commit.template '/etc/git-commit-template'
</code></pre>

<h3>Log Format</h3>

<pre><code>$ git config format.pretty oneline
</code></pre>

<h3>Other Config Options</h3>

<p>There are also a number of interesting options for packing, gc-ing, merging,
remotes, branches, http transport, diffs, paging, whitespace and more.  If you
want to tweak these, check out the <a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-config.html">git config</a> docs.</p>

<h2>Git Hooks</h2>

<p>Hooks are little scripts you can place in $GIT_DIR/hooks directory to trigger
action at certain points. When git-init is run, a handful example hooks are
copied in the hooks directory of the new repository, but by default they are
all disabled. To enable a hook, rename it by removing its .sample suffix.</p>

<h3>applypatch-msg</h3>

<pre><code>GIT_DIR/hooks/applypatch-msg
</code></pre>

<p>This hook is invoked by git-am script. It takes a single parameter, the name
of the file that holds the proposed commit log message. Exiting with non-zero
status causes git-am to abort before applying the patch.</p>

<p>The hook is allowed to edit the message file in place, and can be used to
normalize the message into some project standard format (if the project has one).
It can also be used to refuse the commit after inspecting the message file.
The default applypatch-msg hook, when enabled, runs the commit-msg hook, if the
latter is enabled.</p>

<h3>pre-applypatch</h3>

<pre><code>GIT_DIR/hooks/pre-applypatch
</code></pre>

<p>This hook is invoked by git-am. It takes no parameter, and is invoked after the
patch is applied, but before a commit is made.
If it exits with non-zero status, then the working tree will not be committed
after applying the patch.</p>

<p>It can be used to inspect the current working tree and refuse to make a commit
if it does not pass certain test.
The default pre-applypatch hook, when enabled, runs the pre-commit hook, if the
latter is enabled.</p>

<h3>post-applypatch</h3>

<pre><code>GIT_DIR/hooks/post-applypatch
</code></pre>

<p>This hook is invoked by 'git-am'.  It takes no parameter,
and is invoked after the patch is applied and a commit is made.</p>

<p>This hook is meant primarily for notification, and cannot affect
the outcome of 'git-am'.</p>

<h3>pre-commit</h3>

<pre><code>GIT_DIR/hooks/pre-commit
</code></pre>

<p>This hook is invoked by 'git-commit', and can be bypassed
with <code>\--no-verify</code> option.  It takes no parameter, and is
invoked before obtaining the proposed commit log message and
making a commit.  Exiting with non-zero status from this script
causes the 'git-commit' to abort.</p>

<p>The default 'pre-commit' hook, when enabled, catches introduction
of lines with trailing whitespaces and aborts the commit when
such a line is found.</p>

<p>All the 'git-commit' hooks are invoked with the environment
variable <code>GIT_EDITOR=:</code> if the command will not bring up an editor
to modify the commit message.</p>

<p>Here is an example of a Ruby script that runs RSpec tests before allowing a commit.</p>

</pre>

<h3>prepare-commit-msg</h3>

<pre><code>GIT_DIR/hooks/prepare-commit-msg
</code></pre>

<p>This hook is invoked by 'git-commit' right after preparing the
default log message, and before the editor is started.</p>

<p>It takes one to three parameters.  The first is the name of the file
that the commit log message.  The second is the source of the commit
message, and can be: <code>message</code> (if a <code>-m</code> or <code>-F</code> option was
given); <code>template</code> (if a <code>-t</code> option was given or the
configuration option <code>commit.template</code> is set); <code>merge</code> (if the
commit is a merge or a <code>.git/MERGE_MSG</code> file exists); <code>squash</code>
(if a <code>.git/SQUASH_MSG</code> file exists); or <code>commit</code>, followed by
a commit SHA1 (if a <code>-c</code>, <code>-C</code> or <code>\--amend</code> option was given).</p>

<p>If the exit status is non-zero, 'git-commit' will abort.</p>

<p>The purpose of the hook is to edit the message file in place, and
it is not suppressed by the <code>\--no-verify</code> option.  A non-zero exit
means a failure of the hook and aborts the commit.  It should not
be used as replacement for pre-commit hook.</p>

<p>The sample <code>prepare-commit-msg</code> hook that comes with git comments
out the <code>Conflicts:</code> part of a merge's commit message.</p>

<h3>commit-msg</h3>

<pre><code>GIT_DIR/hooks/commit-msg
</code></pre>

<p>This hook is invoked by 'git-commit', and can be bypassed
with <code>\--no-verify</code> option.  It takes a single parameter, the
name of the file that holds the proposed commit log message.
Exiting with non-zero status causes the 'git-commit' to
abort.</p>

<p>The hook is allowed to edit the message file in place, and can
be used to normalize the message into some project standard
format (if the project has one). It can also be used to refuse
the commit after inspecting the message file.</p>

<p>The default 'commit-msg' hook, when enabled, detects duplicate
"Signed-off-by" lines, and aborts the commit if one is found.</p>

<h3>post-commit</h3>

<pre><code>GIT_DIR/hooks/post-commit
</code></pre>

<p>This hook is invoked by 'git-commit'.  It takes no
parameter, and is invoked after a commit is made.</p>

<p>This hook is meant primarily for notification, and cannot affect
the outcome of 'git-commit'.</p>

<h3>pre-rebase</h3>

<pre><code>GIT_DIR/hooks/pre-rebase
</code></pre>

<p>This hook is called by 'git-rebase' and can be used to prevent a branch
from getting rebased.</p>

<h3>post-checkout</h3>

<pre><code>GIT_DIR/hooks/post-checkout
</code></pre>

<p>This hook is invoked when a 'git-checkout' is run after having updated the
worktree.  The hook is given three parameters: the ref of the previous HEAD,
the ref of the new HEAD (which may or may not have changed), and a flag
indicating whether the checkout was a branch checkout (changing branches,
flag=1) or a file checkout (retrieving a file from the index, flag=0).
This hook cannot affect the outcome of 'git-checkout'.</p>

<p>This hook can be used to perform repository validity checks, auto-display
differences from the previous HEAD if different, or set working dir metadata
properties.</p>

<h3>post-merge</h3>

<pre><code>GIT_DIR/hooks/post-merge
</code></pre>

<p>This hook is invoked by 'git-merge', which happens when a 'git-pull'
is done on a local repository.  The hook takes a single parameter, a status
flag specifying whether or not the merge being done was a squash merge.
This hook cannot affect the outcome of 'git-merge' and is not executed,
if the merge failed due to conflicts.</p>

<p>This hook can be used in conjunction with a corresponding pre-commit hook to
save and restore any form of metadata associated with the working tree
(eg: permissions/ownership, ACLS, etc).  See contrib/hooks/setgitperms.perl
for an example of how to do this.</p>

<h3>pre-receive</h3>

<pre><code>GIT_DIR/hooks/pre-receive
</code></pre>

<p>This hook is invoked by 'git-receive-pack' on the remote repository,
which happens when a 'git-push' is done on a local repository.
Just before starting to update refs on the remote repository, the
pre-receive hook is invoked.  Its exit status determines the success
or failure of the update.</p>

<p>This hook executes once for the receive operation. It takes no
arguments, but for each ref to be updated it receives on standard
input a line of the format:</p>

<p>  <old-value> SP <new-value> SP <ref-name> LF</p>

<p>where <code>&lt;old-value&gt;</code> is the old object name stored in the ref,
<code>&lt;new-value&gt;</code> is the new object name to be stored in the ref and
<code>&lt;ref-name&gt;</code> is the full name of the ref.
When creating a new ref, <code>&lt;old-value&gt;</code> is 40 <code>0</code>.</p>

<p>If the hook exits with non-zero status, none of the refs will be
updated. If the hook exits with zero, updating of individual refs can
still be prevented by the &lt;&lt;update,'update'>> hook.</p>

<p>Both standard output and standard error output are forwarded to
'git-send-pack' on the other end, so you can simply <code>echo</code> messages
for the user.</p>

<p>If you wrote it in Ruby, you might get the args this way:</p>

<pre class="mac_classic">
rev_old, rev_new, ref <span class="Keyword">=</span> <span class="Variable">STDIN</span>.<span class="FunctionName">read</span>.<span class="FunctionName">split</span>(<span class="String"><span class="String">&quot;</span> <span class="String">&quot;</span></span>)
</pre>

<p>Or in a bash script, something like this would work:</p>

<pre><code>#!/bin/sh
# &lt;oldrev&gt; &lt;newrev&gt; &lt;refname&gt;
# update a blame tree
while read oldrev newrev ref
do
    echo "STARTING [$oldrev $newrev $ref]"
    for path in `git diff-tree -r $oldrev..$newrev | awk '{print $6}'`
    do
      echo "git update-ref refs/blametree/$ref/$path $newrev"
      `git update-ref refs/blametree/$ref/$path $newrev`
    done
done
</code></pre>

<h3>update</h3>

<pre><code>GIT_DIR/hooks/update
</code></pre>

<p>This hook is invoked by 'git-receive-pack' on the remote repository,
which happens when a 'git-push' is done on a local repository.
Just before updating the ref on the remote repository, the update hook
is invoked.  Its exit status determines the success or failure of
the ref update.</p>

<p>The hook executes once for each ref to be updated, and takes
three parameters:</p>

<ul>
<li>the name of the ref being updated,</li>
<li>the old object name stored in the ref,</li>
<li>and the new objectname to be stored in the ref.</li>
</ul>


<p>A zero exit from the update hook allows the ref to be updated.
Exiting with a non-zero status prevents 'git-receive-pack'
from updating that ref.</p>

<p>This hook can be used to prevent 'forced' update on certain refs by
making sure that the object name is a commit object that is a
descendant of the commit object named by the old object name.
That is, to enforce a "fast forward only" policy.</p>

<p>It could also be used to log the old..new status.  However, it
does not know the entire set of branches, so it would end up
firing one e-mail per ref when used naively, though.  The
&lt;&lt;post-receive,'post-receive'>> hook is more suited to that.</p>

<p>Another use suggested on the mailing list is to use this hook to
implement access control which is finer grained than the one
based on filesystem group.</p>

<p>Both standard output and standard error output are forwarded to
'git-send-pack' on the other end, so you can simply <code>echo</code> messages
for the user.</p>

<p>The default 'update' hook, when enabled--and with
<code>hooks.allowunannotated</code> config option turned on--prevents
unannotated tags to be pushed.</p>

<h3>post-receive</h3>

<pre><code>GIT_DIR/hooks/post-receive
</code></pre>

<p>This hook is invoked by 'git-receive-pack' on the remote repository,
which happens when a 'git-push' is done on a local repository.
It executes on the remote repository once after all the refs have
been updated.</p>

<p>This hook executes once for the receive operation.  It takes no
arguments, but gets the same information as the
&lt;&lt;pre-receive,'pre-receive'>>
hook does on its standard input.</p>

<p>This hook does not affect the outcome of 'git-receive-pack', as it
is called after the real work is done.</p>

<p>This supersedes the &lt;&lt;post-update,'post-update'>> hook in that it gets
both old and new values of all the refs in addition to their
names.</p>

<p>Both standard output and standard error output are forwarded to
'git-send-pack' on the other end, so you can simply <code>echo</code> messages
for the user.</p>

<p>The default 'post-receive' hook is empty, but there is
a sample script <code>post-receive-email</code> provided in the <code>contrib/hooks</code>
directory in git distribution, which implements sending commit
emails.</p>

<h3>post-update</h3>

<pre><code>GIT_DIR/hooks/post-update
</code></pre>

<p>This hook is invoked by 'git-receive-pack' on the remote repository,
which happens when a 'git-push' is done on a local repository.
It executes on the remote repository once after all the refs have
been updated.</p>

<p>It takes a variable number of parameters, each of which is the
name of ref that was actually updated.</p>

<p>This hook is meant primarily for notification, and cannot affect
the outcome of 'git-receive-pack'.</p>

<p>The 'post-update' hook can tell what are the heads that were pushed,
but it does not know what their original and updated values are,
so it is a poor place to do log old..new. The
&lt;&lt;post-receive,'post-receive'>> hook does get both original and
updated values of the refs. You might consider it instead if you need
them.</p>

<p>When enabled, the default 'post-update' hook runs
'git-update-server-info' to keep the information used by dumb
transports (e.g., HTTP) up-to-date.  If you are publishing
a git repository that is accessible via HTTP, you should
probably enable this hook.</p>

<p>Both standard output and standard error output are forwarded to
'git-send-pack' on the other end, so you can simply <code>echo</code> messages
for the user.</p>

<h3>pre-auto-gc</h3>

<pre><code>GIT_DIR/hooks/pre-auto-gc
</code></pre>

<p>This hook is invoked by 'git-gc --auto'. It takes no parameter, and
exiting with non-zero status from this script causes the 'git-gc --auto'
to abort.</p>

<h2>Submodules</h2>

<p>Large projects are often composed of smaller, self-contained modules.  For
example, an embedded Linux distribution's source tree would include every
piece of software in the distribution with some local modifications; a movie
player might need to build against a specific, known-working version of a
decompression library; several independent programs might all share the same
build scripts.</p>

<p>With centralized revision control systems this is often accomplished by
including every module in one single repository.  Developers can check out
all modules or only the modules they need to work with.  They can even modify
files across several modules in a single commit while moving things around
or updating APIs and translations.</p>

<p>Git does not allow partial checkouts, so duplicating this approach in Git
would force developers to keep a local copy of modules they are not
interested in touching.  Commits in an enormous checkout would be slower
than you'd expect as Git would have to scan every directory for changes.
If modules have a lot of local history, clones would take forever.</p>

<p>On the plus side, distributed revision control systems can much better
integrate with external sources.  In a centralized model, a single arbitrary
snapshot of the external project is exported from its own revision control
and then imported into the local revision control on a vendor branch.  All
the history is hidden.  With distributed revision control you can clone the
entire external history and much more easily follow development and re-merge
local changes.</p>

<p>Git's submodule support allows a repository to contain, as a subdirectory, a
checkout of an external project.  Submodules maintain their own identity;
the submodule support just stores the submodule repository location and
commit ID, so other developers who clone the containing project
("superproject") can easily clone all the submodules at the same revision.
Partial checkouts of the superproject are possible: you can tell Git to
clone none, some or all of the submodules.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-submodule.html">git submodule</a> command is available since Git 1.5.3.  Users
with Git 1.5.2 can look up the submodule commits in the repository and
manually check them out; earlier versions won't recognize the submodules at
all.</p>

<p>To see how submodule support works, create (for example) four example
repositories that can be used later as a submodule:</p>

<pre><code>$ mkdir ~/git
$ cd ~/git
$ for i in a b c d
do
    mkdir $i
    cd $i
    git init
    echo "module $i" &gt; $i.txt
    git add $i.txt
    git commit -m "Initial commit, submodule $i"
    cd ..
done
</code></pre>

<p>Now create the superproject and add all the submodules:</p>

<pre><code>$ mkdir super
$ cd super
$ git init
$ for i in a b c d
do
    git submodule add ~/git/$i $i
done
</code></pre>

<p>NOTE: Do not use local URLs here if you plan to publish your superproject!</p>

<p>See what files <code>git-submodule</code> created:</p>

<pre><code>$ ls -a
.  ..  .git  .gitmodules  a  b  c  d
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>git-submodule add</code> command does a couple of things:</p>

<ul>
<li>It clones the submodule under the current directory and by default checks out
the master branch.</li>
<li>It adds the submodule's clone path to the <a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/gitmodules.html">gitmodules</a> file and
adds this file to the index, ready to be committed.</li>
<li>It adds the submodule's current commit ID to the index, ready to be
committed.</li>
</ul>


<p>Commit the superproject:</p>

<pre><code>$ git commit -m "Add submodules a, b, c and d."
</code></pre>

<p>Now clone the superproject:</p>

<pre><code>$ cd ..
$ git clone super cloned
$ cd cloned
</code></pre>

<p>The submodule directories are there, but they're empty:</p>

<pre><code>$ ls -a a
.  ..
$ git submodule status
-d266b9873ad50488163457f025db7cdd9683d88b a
-e81d457da15309b4fef4249aba9b50187999670d b
-c1536a972b9affea0f16e0680ba87332dc059146 c
-d96249ff5d57de5de093e6baff9e0aafa5276a74 d
</code></pre>

<p>NOTE: The commit object names shown above would be different for you, but they
should match the HEAD commit object names of your repositories.  You can check
it by running <code>git ls-remote ../git/a</code>.</p>

<p>Pulling down the submodules is a two-step process. First run <code>git submodule
init</code> to add the submodule repository URLs to <code>.git/config</code>:</p>

<pre><code>$ git submodule init
</code></pre>

<p>Now use <code>git-submodule update</code> to clone the repositories and check out the
commits specified in the superproject:</p>

<pre><code>$ git submodule update
$ cd a
$ ls -a
.  ..  .git  a.txt
</code></pre>

<p>One major difference between <code>git-submodule update</code> and <code>git-submodule add</code> is
that <code>git-submodule update</code> checks out a specific commit, rather than the tip
of a branch. It's like checking out a tag: the head is detached, so you're not
working on a branch.</p>

<pre><code>$ git branch
* (no branch)
master
</code></pre>

<p>If you want to make a change within a submodule and you have a detached head,
then you should create or checkout a branch, make your changes, publish the
change within the submodule, and then update the superproject to reference the
new commit:</p>

<pre><code>$ git checkout master
</code></pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre><code>$ git checkout -b fix-up
</code></pre>

<p>then</p>

<pre><code>$ echo "adding a line again" &gt;&gt; a.txt
$ git commit -a -m "Updated the submodule from within the superproject."
$ git push
$ cd ..
$ git diff
diff --git a/a b/a
index d266b98..261dfac 160000

$ git commit -m "Updated submodule a."
$ git push
</code></pre>

<p>You have to run <code>git submodule update</code> after <code>git pull</code> if you want to update
submodules, too.</p>

<h3>Pitfalls with submodules</h3>

<p>Always publish the submodule change before publishing the change to the
superproject that references it. If you forget to publish the submodule change,
others won't be able to clone the repository:</p>

<pre><code>$ cd ~/git/super/a
$ echo i added another line to this file &gt;&gt; a.txt
$ git commit -a -m "doing it wrong this time"
$ cd ..
$ git add a
$ git commit -m "Updated submodule a again."
$ git push
$ cd ~/git/cloned
$ git pull
$ git submodule update
error: pathspec '261dfac35cb99d380eb966e102c1197139f7fa24' did not match any file(s) known to git.
Did you forget to 'git add'?
Unable to checkout '261dfac35cb99d380eb966e102c1197139f7fa24' in submodule path 'a'
</code></pre>

<p>If you are staging an updated submodule for commit manually, be careful to not
add a trailing slash when specifying the path. With the slash appended, Git
will assume you are removing the submodule and checking that directory's
contents into the containing repository.</p>

<pre><code>$ cd ~/git/super/a
$ echo i added another line to this file &gt;&gt; a.txt
$ git commit -a -m "doing it wrong this time"
$ cd ..
$ git add a/
$ git status
# On branch master
# Changes to be committed:
#   (use "git reset HEAD &lt;file&gt;..." to unstage)
#
#       deleted:    a
#       new file:   a/a.txt
#
# Modified submodules:
#
# * a aa5c351...0000000 (1):
#   &lt; Initial commit, submodule a
#
</code></pre>

<p>To fix the index after performing this operation, reset the changes and then
add the submodule without the trailing slash.</p>

<pre><code>$ git reset HEAD A
$ git add a
$ git status
# On branch master
# Changes to be committed:
#   (use "git reset HEAD &lt;file&gt;..." to unstage)
#
#       modified:   a
#
# Modified submodules:
#
# * a aa5c351...8d3ba36 (1):
#   &gt; doing it wrong this time
#
</code></pre>

<p>You also should not rewind branches in a submodule beyond commits that were
ever recorded in any superproject.</p>

<p>It's not safe to run <code>git submodule update</code> if you've made and committed
changes within a submodule without checking out a branch first. They will be
silently overwritten:</p>

<pre><code>$ cat a.txt
module a
$ echo line added from private2 &gt;&gt; a.txt
$ git commit -a -m "line added inside private2"
$ cd ..
$ git submodule update
Submodule path 'a': checked out 'd266b9873ad50488163457f025db7cdd9683d88b'
$ cd a
$ cat a.txt
module a
</code></pre>

<p>NOTE: The changes are still visible in the submodule's reflog.</p>

<p>This is not the case if you did not commit your changes.</p>

<h2>Subversion Integration</h2>

<h2>SCM Migration</h2>

<p>So you've made the decision to move away from your existing system
and convert your whole project to Git.  How can you do that easily?</p>

<h3>Importing Subversion</h3>

<p>Git comes with a script called git-svn that has a clone command that
will import a subversion repository into a new git repository.  There
is also a free tool on the GitHub service that will do this for you.</p>

<pre><code>$ git-svn clone http://my-project.googlecode.com/svn/trunk new-project
</code></pre>

<p>This will give you a new Git repository with all the history of the
original Subversion repo.  This takes a pretty good amount of time, generally,
since it starts with version 1 and checks out and commits locally every
single revision one by one.</p>

<h3>Importing Perforce</h3>

<p>In contrib/fast-import you will find the git-p4 script, which is a
Python script that will import a Perforce repository for you.</p>

<pre><code>$ ~/git.git/contrib/fast-import/git-p4 clone //depot/project/main@all myproject
</code></pre>

<h3>Importing Others</h3>

<p>These are other SCMs that listed high on the Git Survey, should find import
docs for them.  !!TODO!!</p>

<ul>
<li>CVS</li>
<li><p>Mercurial (hg)</p></li>
<li><p>Bazaar-NG</p></li>
<li>Darcs</li>
<li>ClearCase</li>
</ul>


<h2>Graphical Git</h2>

<p>Git has a couple of fairly popular Graphial User Interfaces that can
read and/or maniplulate Git repositories.</p>

<h3>Bundled GUIs</h3>

<p>Git comes with two major GUI programs written in Tcl/Tk.  Gitk is a
repository browser and commit history visualization tool.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/gitk.html">gitk</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-gui.html">git gui</a> is a tool that helps you visualize the index operations,
like add, remove and commit.  It won't do everything you can do on the
command line, but for many of the basic operations, it's pretty good.</p>

<h2>How Git Stores Objects</h2>

<p>This chapter goes into detail about how Git physically stores objects.</p>

<p>All objects are stored as compressed contents by their sha values.  They
contain the object type, size and contents in a gzipped format.</p>

<p>There are two formats that Git keeps objects in - loose objects and
packed objects.</p>

<h3>Loose Objects</h3>

<p>Loose objects are the simpler format.  It is simply the compressed data stored
in a single file on disk.  Every object written to a seperate file.</p>

<p>If the sha of your object is <code>ab04d884140f7b0cf8bbf86d6883869f16a46f65</code>,
then the file will be stored in the following path:</p>

<pre><code>GIT_DIR/objects/ab/04d884140f7b0cf8bbf86d6883869f16a46f65
</code></pre>

<p>It pulls the first two characters off and uses that as the subdirectory, so that
there are never too many objects in one directory.  The actual file name is
the remaining 38 characters.</p>

<p>The easiest way to describe exactly how the object data is stored is this Ruby
implementation of object storage:</p>

<pre class="mac_classic">
<span class="Keyword">def</span> <span class="FunctionName">put_raw_object</span>(<span class="FunctionParameter">content<span class="FunctionParameter">,</span> type</span>)
  size <span class="Keyword">=</span> content.<span class="FunctionName">length</span>.<span class="FunctionName">to_s</span>

  header <span class="Keyword">=</span> <span class="String"><span class="String">&quot;</span><span class="StringInterpolation"><span class="StringInterpolation">#{</span>type<span class="StringInterpolation">}</span></span> <span class="StringInterpolation"><span class="StringInterpolation">#{</span>size<span class="StringInterpolation">}</span></span><span class="StringInterpolation">\</span>0<span class="String">&quot;</span></span> <span class="Comment"><span class="Comment">#</span> type(space)size(null byte)</span>
  store <span class="Keyword">=</span> header <span class="Keyword">+</span> content

  sha1 <span class="Keyword">=</span> <span class="LibraryObject">Digest</span>::<span class="FunctionName">SHA1</span>.<span class="FunctionName">hexdigest</span>(store)
  path <span class="Keyword">=</span> <span class="Variable"><span class="Variable">@</span>git_dir</span> <span class="Keyword">+</span> <span class="String"><span class="String">'</span>/<span class="String">'</span></span> <span class="Keyword">+</span> sha1[<span class="Number">0</span>...<span class="Number">2</span>] <span class="Keyword">+</span> <span class="String"><span class="String">'</span>/<span class="String">'</span></span> <span class="Keyword">+</span> sha1[<span class="Number">2</span>..<span class="Number">40</span>]

  <span class="Keyword">if</span> <span class="Keyword">!</span><span class="LibraryObject">File</span>.<span class="FunctionName">exists?</span>(path)
    content <span class="Keyword">=</span> <span class="LibraryObject">Zlib</span>::<span class="FunctionName">Deflate</span>.<span class="FunctionName">deflate</span>(store)

    <span class="LibraryObject">FileUtils</span>.<span class="FunctionName">mkdir_p</span>(<span class="Variable"><span class="Variable">@</span>directory</span><span class="Keyword">+</span><span class="String"><span class="String">'</span>/<span class="String">'</span></span><span class="Keyword">+</span>sha1[<span class="Number">0</span>...<span class="Number">2</span>])
    <span class="LibraryObject">File</span>.<span class="FunctionName">open</span>(path, <span class="String"><span class="String">'</span>w<span class="String">'</span></span>) <span class="Keyword">do </span>|<span class="Variable">f</span>|
      f.<span class="FunctionName">write</span> content
    <span class="Keyword">end</span>
  <span class="Keyword">end</span>
  <span class="Keyword">return</span> sha1
<span class="Keyword">end</span>
</pre>

<h3>Packed Objects</h3>

<p>The other format for object storage is the packfile. Since Git stores each
version of each file as a seperate object, it can get pretty inefficient.
Imagine having a file several thousand lines long and changing a single line.
Git will store the second file in it's entirety, which is a great big waste
of space.</p>

<p>In order to save that space, Git utilizes the packfile.  This is a format
where Git will only save the part that has changed in the second file, with
a pointer to the file it is similar to.</p>

<p>When objects are written to disk, it is often in the loose format, since
that format is less expensive to access.  However, eventually you'll want
to save the space by packing up the objects - this is done with the
<a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-gc.html">git gc</a> command.  It will use a rather complicated heuristic to
determine which files are likely most similar and base the deltas off that
analysis.  There can be multiple packfiles, they can be repacked if neccesary
(<a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-repack.html">git repack</a>) or unpacked back into loose files
(<a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-unpack-objects.html">git unpack-objects</a>) relatively easily.</p>

<p>Git will also write out an index file for each packfile that is much smaller
and contains offsets into the packfile to more quickly find specific objects
by sha.</p>

<p>The actual details of the packfile implementation are found in the Packfile
chapter a little later on.</p>

<h2>Browsing Git Objects</h2>

<p>We can ask git about particular objects with the cat-file
command. Note that you can shorten the shas to only a few
characters to save yourself typing all 40 hex digits:</p>

<pre><code>$ git-cat-file -t 54196cc2
commit
$ git-cat-file commit 54196cc2
tree 92b8b694ffb1675e5975148e1121810081dbdffe

</code></pre>

<p>A tree can refer to one or more "blob" objects, each corresponding to
a file.  In addition, a tree can also refer to other tree objects,
thus creating a directory hierarchy.  You can examine the contents of
any tree using ls-tree (remember that a long enough initial portion
of the SHA1 will also work):</p>

<pre><code>$ git ls-tree 92b8b694
100644 blob 3b18e512dba79e4c8300dd08aeb37f8e728b8dad    file.txt
</code></pre>

<p>Thus we see that this tree has one file in it.  The SHA1 hash is a
reference to that file's data:</p>

<pre><code>$ git cat-file -t 3b18e512
blob
</code></pre>

<p>A "blob" is just file data, which we can also examine with cat-file:</p>

<pre><code>$ git cat-file blob 3b18e512
hello world
</code></pre>

<p>Note that this is the old file data; so the object that git named in
its response to the initial tree was a tree with a snapshot of the
directory state that was recorded by the first commit.</p>

<p>All of these objects are stored under their SHA1 names inside the git
directory:</p>

<pre><code>$ find .git/objects/
.git/objects/
.git/objects/pack
.git/objects/info
.git/objects/3b
.git/objects/3b/18e512dba79e4c8300dd08aeb37f8e728b8dad
.git/objects/92
.git/objects/92/b8b694ffb1675e5975148e1121810081dbdffe
.git/objects/54
.git/objects/54/196cc2703dc165cbd373a65a4dcf22d50ae7f7
.git/objects/a0
.git/objects/a0/423896973644771497bdc03eb99d5281615b51
.git/objects/d0
.git/objects/d0/492b368b66bdabf2ac1fd8c92b39d3db916e59
.git/objects/c4
.git/objects/c4/d59f390b9cfd4318117afde11d601c1085f241
</code></pre>

<p>and the contents of these files is just the compressed data plus a
header identifying their length and their type.  The type is either a
blob, a tree, a commit, or a tag.</p>

<p>The simplest commit to find is the HEAD commit, which we can find
from .git/HEAD:</p>

<pre><code>$ cat .git/HEAD
ref: refs/heads/master
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, this tells us which branch we're currently on, and it
tells us this by naming a file under the .git directory, which itself
contains a SHA1 name referring to a commit object, which we can
examine with cat-file:</p>

<pre><code>$ cat .git/refs/heads/master
c4d59f390b9cfd4318117afde11d601c1085f241
$ git cat-file -t c4d59f39
commit
$ git cat-file commit c4d59f39

committer J. Bruce Fields &lt;bfields@puzzle.fieldses.org&gt; 1143418702 -0500

add emphasis
</code></pre>

<p>The "tree" object here refers to the new state of the tree:</p>

<pre><code>$ git ls-tree d0492b36
100644 blob a0423896973644771497bdc03eb99d5281615b51    file.txt
$ git cat-file blob a0423896
hello world!
</code></pre>

<p>and the "parent" object refers to the previous commit:</p>

<pre><code>$ git-cat-file commit 54196cc2
tree 92b8b694ffb1675e5975148e1121810081dbdffe
author J. Bruce Fields &lt;bfields@puzzle.fieldses.org&gt; 1143414668 -0500
committer J. Bruce Fields &lt;bfields@puzzle.fieldses.org&gt; 1143414668 -0500
</code></pre>

<h2>Git References</h2>

<p>Branches, remote-tracking branches, and tags are all references to
commits.  All references are named with a slash-separated path name
starting with "refs"; the names we've been using so far are actually
shorthand:</p>

<pre><code>- The branch "test" is short for "refs/heads/test".
- The tag "v2.6.18" is short for "refs/tags/v2.6.18".
- "origin/master" is short for "refs/remotes/origin/master".
</code></pre>

<p>The full name is occasionally useful if, for example, there ever
exists a tag and a branch with the same name.</p>

<p>(Newly created refs are actually stored in the .git/refs directory,
under the path given by their name.  However, for efficiency reasons
they may also be packed together in a single file; see
<a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-pack-refs.html">git pack-refs</a>).</p>

<p>As another useful shortcut, the "HEAD" of a repository can be referred
to just using the name of that repository.  So, for example, "origin"
is usually a shortcut for the HEAD branch in the repository "origin".</p>

<p>For the complete list of paths which git checks for references, and
the order it uses to decide which to choose when there are multiple
references with the same shorthand name, see the "SPECIFYING
REVISIONS" section of <a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-rev-parse.html">git rev-parse</a>.</p>

<h3>Showing commits unique to a given branch</h3>

<p>Suppose you would like to see all the commits reachable from the branch
head named "master" but not from any other head in your repository.</p>

<p>We can list all the heads in this repository with
<a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-show-ref.html">git show-ref</a>:</p>

<pre><code>$ git show-ref --heads
bf62196b5e363d73353a9dcf094c59595f3153b7 refs/heads/core-tutorial
db768d5504c1bb46f63ee9d6e1772bd047e05bf9 refs/heads/maint
a07157ac624b2524a059a3414e99f6f44bebc1e7 refs/heads/master
24dbc180ea14dc1aebe09f14c8ecf32010690627 refs/heads/tutorial-2
1e87486ae06626c2f31eaa63d26fc0fd646c8af2 refs/heads/tutorial-fixes
</code></pre>

<p>We can get just the branch-head names, and remove "master", with
the help of the standard utilities cut and grep:</p>

<pre><code>$ git show-ref --heads | cut -d' ' -f2 | grep -v '^refs/heads/master'
refs/heads/core-tutorial
refs/heads/maint
refs/heads/tutorial-2
refs/heads/tutorial-fixes
</code></pre>

<p>And then we can ask to see all the commits reachable from master
but not from these other heads:</p>

<pre><code>$ gitk master --not $( git show-ref --heads | cut -d' ' -f2 |
                grep -v '^refs/heads/master' )
</code></pre>

<p>Obviously, endless variations are possible; for example, to see all
commits reachable from some head but not from any tag in the repository:</p>

<pre><code>$ gitk $( git show-ref --heads ) --not  $( git show-ref --tags )
</code></pre>

<p>(See <a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-rev-parse.html">git rev-parse</a> for explanations of commit-selecting
syntax such as <code>--not</code>.)</p>

<p>(!!update-ref!!)</p>

<h2>The Git Index</h2>

<p>The index is a binary file (generally kept in .git/index) containing a
sorted list of path names, each with permissions and the SHA1 of a blob
object; <a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-ls-files.html">git ls-files</a> can show you the contents of the index:</p>

<pre><code>$ git ls-files --stage
100644 63c918c667fa005ff12ad89437f2fdc80926e21c 0   .gitignore
100644 5529b198e8d14decbe4ad99db3f7fb632de0439d 0   .mailmap
100644 6ff87c4664981e4397625791c8ea3bbb5f2279a3 0   COPYING
100644 a37b2152bd26be2c2289e1f57a292534a51a93c7 0   Documentation/.gitignore
100644 fbefe9a45b00a54b58d94d06eca48b03d40a50e0 0   Documentation/Makefile
...
100644 2511aef8d89ab52be5ec6a5e46236b4b6bcd07ea 0   xdiff/xtypes.h
100644 2ade97b2574a9f77e7ae4002a4e07a6a38e46d07 0   xdiff/xutils.c
100644 d5de8292e05e7c36c4b68857c1cf9855e3d2f70a 0   xdiff/xutils.h
</code></pre>

<p>Note that in older documentation you may see the index called the
"current directory cache" or just the "cache".  It has three important
properties:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The index contains all the information necessary to generate a single
 (uniquely determined) tree object.</p>

<p> For example, running <a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-commit.html">git commit</a> generates this tree object
 from the index, stores it in the object database, and uses it as the
 tree object associated with the new commit.</p></li>
<li><p>The index enables fast comparisons between the tree object it defines
 and the working tree.</p>

<p> It does this by storing some additional data for each entry (such as
 the last modified time).  This data is not displayed above, and is not
 stored in the created tree object, but it can be used to determine
 quickly which files in the working directory differ from what was
 stored in the index, and thus save git from having to read all of the
 data from such files to look for changes.</p></li>
<li><p>It can efficiently represent information about merge conflicts
 between different tree objects, allowing each pathname to be
 associated with sufficient information about the trees involved that
 you can create a three-way merge between them.</p>

<p> During a merge, the index can
 store multiple versions of a single file (called "stages").  The third
 column in the <a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-ls-files.html">git ls-files</a> output above is the stage
 number, and will take on values other than 0 for files with merge
 conflicts.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>The index is thus a sort of temporary staging area, which is filled with
a tree which you are in the process of working on.</p>

<h2>The Packfile</h2>

<p>This chapter explains in detail, down to the bits, how the packfile and
pack index files are formatted.</p>

<h3>The Packfile Index</h3>

<p>First off, we have the packfile index, which is basically just a series of
bookmarks into a packfile.</p>

<p>There are two versions of the packfile index - version one, which is the default
in versions of Git earlier than 1.6, and version two, which is the default
from 1.6 forward, but which can be read by Git versions going back to 1.5.2, and
has been further backported to 1.4.4.5 if you are still on the 1.4 series.</p>

<p>Version 2 also includes a CRC checksum of each object so compressed data
can be copied directly from pack to pack during repacking without
undetected data corruption.  Version 2 indexes can also handle packfiles
larger than 4 Gb.</p>

<p><div class="center"><img src="assets/images/figure/packfile-index.png"></div></p>

<p>In both formats, the fanout table is simply a way to find the offset of a
particular sha faster within the index file.  The offset/sha1[]
tables are sorted by sha1[] values (this is to allow binary search of this
table), and fanout[] table points at the offset/sha1[] table in a specific
way (so that part of the latter table that covers all hashes that start
with a given byte can be found to avoid 8 iterations of the binary
search).</p>

<p>In version 1, the offsets and shas are in the same space, where in version two,
there are seperate tables
for the shas, crc checksums and offsets.  At the end of both files are
checksum shas for both the index file and the packfile it references.</p>

<p>Importantly, packfile indexes are <em>not</em> neccesary to extract objects from
a packfile, they are simply used to <em>quickly</em> retrieve individual objects from
a pack.  The packfile format is used in upload-pack and receieve-pack programs
(push and fetch protocols) to transfer objects and there is no index used then
- it can be built after the fact by scanning the packfile.</p>

<h3>The Packfile Format</h3>

<p>The packfile itself is a very simple format.  There is a header, a series of
packed objects (each with it's own header and body) and then a checksum trailer.
The first four bytes is the string 'PACK', which is sort of used to make sure
you're getting the start of the packfile correctly.  This is followed by a 4-byte
packfile version number and then a 4-byte number of entries in that file.  In
Ruby, you might read the header data like this:</p>

<pre class="mac_classic">
<span class="Keyword">def</span> <span class="FunctionName">read_pack_header</span>
  sig <span class="Keyword">=</span> <span class="Variable"><span class="Variable">@</span>session</span>.<span class="FunctionName">recv</span>(<span class="Number">4</span>)
  ver <span class="Keyword">=</span> <span class="Variable"><span class="Variable">@</span>session</span>.<span class="FunctionName">recv</span>(<span class="Number">4</span>).<span class="FunctionName">unpack</span>(<span class="String"><span class="String">&quot;</span>N<span class="String">&quot;</span></span>)[<span class="Number">0</span>]
  entries <span class="Keyword">=</span> <span class="Variable"><span class="Variable">@</span>session</span>.<span class="FunctionName">recv</span>(<span class="Number">4</span>).<span class="FunctionName">unpack</span>(<span class="String"><span class="String">&quot;</span>N<span class="String">&quot;</span></span>)[<span class="Number">0</span>]
  [sig, ver, entries]
<span class="Keyword">end</span>
</pre>

<p>After that, you get a series of packed objects, in order of thier SHAs
which each consist of an object header and object contents.  At the end
of the packfile is a 20-byte SHA1 sum of all the shas (in sorted order) in that
packfile.</p>

<p><div class="center"><img src="assets/images/figure/packfile-format.png"></div></p>

<p>The object header is a series of one or more 1 byte (8 bit) hunks that
specify the type of object the following data is, and the size of the data
when expanded.  Each byte is really 7 bits of data, with the first bit being
used to say if that hunk is the last one or not before the data starts.  If
the first bit is a 1, you will read another byte, otherwise the data starts
next.  The first 3 bits in the first byte specifies the type of data,
according to the table below.</p>

<p>(Currently, of the 8 values that can be expressed
with 3 bits (0-7), 0 (000) is 'undefined' and 5 (101) is not yet used.)</p>

<p>Here, we can see an example of a header of two bytes, where the first
specifies that the following data is a commit, and the remainder of the first
and the last 7 bits of the second specifies that the data will be 144 bytes
when expanded.</p>

<p><div class="center"><img src="assets/images/figure/packfile-logic.png"></div></p>

<p>It is important to note that the size specified in the header data is not
the size of the data that actually follows, but the size of that data <em>when
expanded</em>. This is why the offsets in the packfile index are so useful,
otherwise you have to expand every object just to tell when the next header
starts.</p>

<p>The data part is just zlib stream for non-delta object types; for the two
delta object representations, the data portion contains something that
identifies which base object this delta representation depends on, and the
delta to apply on the base object to resurrect this object.  <code>ref-delta</code>
uses 20-byte hash of the base object at the beginning of data, while
<code>ofs-delta</code> stores an offset within the same packfile to identify the base
object.  In either case, two important constraints a reimplementor must
adhere to are:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>delta representation must be based on some other object within the same
packfile;</p></li>
<li><p>the base object must be of the same underlying type (blob, tree, commit
or tag);</p>

<h2>Raw Git</h2></li>
</ul>


<p>Here we will take a look at how to manipulate git at a more raw level, in
case you would like to write a tool that generates new blobs, trees or commits
in a more artificial way.  If you want to write a script that uses more low-level
git plumbing to do something new, here are some of the tools you'll need.</p>

<h3>Creating Blobs</h3>

<p>Creating a blob in your Git repository and getting a SHA back is pretty easy.
The <a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-hash-object.html">git hash-object</a> command is all you'll need.  To create a blob
object from an existing file, just run it with the '-w' option (which tells it
to write the blob, not just compute the SHA).</p>

<pre><code>$ git hash-object -w myfile.txt
6ff87c4664981e4397625791c8ea3bbb5f2279a3

$ git hash-object -w myfile2.txt
3bb0e8592a41ae3185ee32266c860714980dbed7
</code></pre>

<p>The STDOUT output of the command will the the SHA of the blob that was created.</p>

<h3>Creating Trees</h3>

<p>Now lets say you want to create a tree from your new objects.
The <a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-mktree.html">git mktree</a> command makes it pretty simple to generate new
tree objects from <a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-ls-tree.html">git ls-tree</a> formatted output.  For example, if
you write the following to a file named '/tmp/tree.txt' :</p>

<pre><code>100644 blob 6ff87c4664981e4397625791c8ea3bbb5f2279a3    file1
100644 blob 3bb0e8592a41ae3185ee32266c860714980dbed7    file2
</code></pre>

<p>and then piped that through the <a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-mktree.html">git mktree</a> command, Git will
write a new tree to the object database and give you back the new sha of that
tree.</p>

<pre><code>$ cat /tmp/tree.txt | git mk-tree
f66a66ab6a7bfe86d52a66516ace212efa00fe1f
</code></pre>

<p>Then, we can take that and make it a subdirectory of yet another tree, and so
on.  If we wanted to create a new tree with that one as a subtree, we just
create a new file (/tmp/newtree.txt) with our new SHA as a tree in it:</p>

<pre><code>100644 blob 6ff87c4664981e4397625791c8ea3bbb5f2279a3    file1-copy
040000 tree f66a66ab6a7bfe86d52a66516ace212efa00fe1f    our_files
</code></pre>

<p>and then use <a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-mk-tree.html">git mk-tree</a> again:</p>

<pre><code>$ cat /tmp/newtree.txt | git mk-tree
5bac6559179bd543a024d6d187692343e2d8ae83
</code></pre>

<p>And we now have an artificial directory structure in Git that looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>.
|-- file1-copy
`-- our_files
    |-- file1
    `-- file2

1 directory, 3 files
</code></pre>

<p>without that structure ever having actually existed on disk.  Plus, we have
a SHA (<code>5bac6559</code>) that points to it.</p>

<h3>Rearranging Trees</h3>

<p>We can also do tree manipulation by combining trees into new structures using
the index file.  As a simple example, let's take the tree we just created and
make a new tree that has two copies of our <code>5bac6559</code> tree in it
using a temporary index file. (You can do this by resetting the GIT_INDEX_FILE
environment variable or on the command line)</p>

<p>First, we read the tree into our index file under a new prefix using the
<a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-read-tree.html">git read-tree</a> command, and then write the index contents as
a tree using the <a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-write-tree.html">git write-tree</a> command:</p>

<pre><code>$ export GIT_INDEX_FILE=/tmp/index
$ git read-tree --prefix=copy1/  5bac6559
$ git read-tree --prefix=copy2/  5bac6559
$ git write-tree 
bb2fa6de7625322322382215d9ea78cfe76508c1

$&gt;git ls-tree bb2fa
040000 tree 5bac6559179bd543a024d6d187692343e2d8ae83    copy1
040000 tree 5bac6559179bd543a024d6d187692343e2d8ae83    copy2
</code></pre>

<p>So now we can see that we've created a new tree just from index manipulation.
You can also do interesting merge operations and such in a temporary index
this way - see the <a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-read-tree.html">git read-tree</a> docs for more information.</p>

<h3>Creating Commits</h3>

<p>Now that we have a tree SHA, we can create a commit object that points to it.
We can do this using the <a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-commit-tree.html">git commit-tree</a> command.  Most of the data
that goes into the commit has to be set as environment variables, so you'll want
to set the following:</p>

<pre><code>GIT_AUTHOR_NAME
GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL
GIT_AUTHOR_DATE
GIT_COMMITTER_NAME
GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL
GIT_COMMITTER_DATE
</code></pre>

<p>Then you will need to write your commit message to a file or somehow pipe it
into the command through STDIN. Then, you can create your commit object
based on the tree sha we have.</p>

<pre><code>$ git commit-tree bb2fa &lt; /tmp/message
a5f85ba5875917319471dfd98dfc636c1dc65650
</code></pre>

<p>If you want to specify one or more parent commits, simply add the shas on the
command line with a '-p' option before each.  The SHA of the new commit object
will be returned via STDOUT.</p>

<h3>Updating a Branch Ref</h3>

<p>Now that we have a new commit object SHA, we can update a branch to point to
it if we want to.  Lets say we want to update our 'master' branch to point to
the new commit we just created - we would use the <a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-update-ref.html">git update-ref</a>
command:</p>

<pre><code>$ git update-ref refs/heads/master a5f85ba5875917319471dfd98dfc636c1dc65650
</code></pre>

<h2>Transfer Protocols</h2>

<p>Here we will go over how clients and servers talk to each other to
transfer Git data around.</p>

<h3>Fetching Data over HTTP</h3>

<p>Fetching over an http/s URL will make Git use a slightly dumber protocol.
In this case, all of the logic is entirely on the client side.  The server
requires no special setup - any static webserver will work fine if the
git directory you are fetching from is in the webserver path.</p>

<p>In order for this to work, you do need to run a single command on the
server repo everytime anything is updated, though - <a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-update-server-info.html">git update-server-info</a>,
which updates the objects/info/packs and info/refs files to list which refs
and packfiles are available, since you can't do a listing over http.  When
that command is run, the objects/info/packs file looks something like this:</p>

<pre><code>P pack-ce2bd34abc3d8ebc5922dc81b2e1f30bf17c10cc.pack
P pack-7ad5f5d05f5e20025898c95296fe4b9c861246d8.pack
</code></pre>

<p>So that if the fetch can't find a loose file, it can try these packfiles.  The
info/refs file will look something like this:</p>

<pre><code>184063c9b594f8968d61a686b2f6052779551613    refs/heads/development
32aae7aef7a412d62192f710f2130302997ec883    refs/heads/master
</code></pre>

<p>Then when you fetch from this repo, it will start with these refs and walk the
commit objects until the client has all the objects that it needs.</p>

<p>For instance, if you ask to fetch the master branch, it will see that master is
pointing to <code>32aae7ae</code> and that your master is pointing to <code>ab04d88</code>,
so you need <code>32aae7ae</code>.  You fetch that object</p>

<pre><code>CONNECT http://myserver.com
GET /git/myproject.git/objects/32/aae7aef7a412d62192f710f2130302997ec883 - 200
</code></pre>

<p>and it looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>tree aa176fb83a47d00386be237b450fb9dfb5be251a

added chapters on private repo setup, scm migration, raw git
</code></pre>

<p>So now it fetches the tree <code>aa176fb8</code>:</p>

<pre><code>GET /git/myproject.git/objects/aa/176fb83a47d00386be237b450fb9dfb5be251a - 200
</code></pre>

<p>which looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>100644 blob 6ff87c4664981e4397625791c8ea3bbb5f2279a3    COPYING

</code></pre>

<p>So then it fetches those objects:</p>

<pre><code>GET /git/myproject.git/objects/6f/f87c4664981e4397625791c8ea3bbb5f2279a3 - 200
GET /git/myproject.git/objects/97/b51a6d3685b093cfb345c9e79516e5099a13fb - 200
GET /git/myproject.git/objects/9d/1b23b8660817e4a74006f15fae86e2a508c573 - 200
</code></pre>

<p>It actually does this with Curl, and can open up multiple parallel threads to
speed up this process.  When it's done recursing the tree pointed to by the
commit, it fetches the next parent.</p>

<pre><code>GET /git/myproject.git/objects/bd/71cad2d597d0f1827d4a3f67bb96a646f02889 - 200
</code></pre>

<p>Now in this case, the commit that comes back looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>tree b4cc00cf8546edd4fcf29defc3aec14de53e6cf8

committer Scott Chacon &lt;schacon@gmail.com&gt; 1220421161 -0700

added chapters on the packfile and how git stores objects
</code></pre>

<p>and we can see that the parent, <code>ab04d88</code> is where our master branch
is currently pointing.  So, we recursively fetch this tree and then stop, since
we know we have everything before this point.  You can force Git to double check
that we have everything with the '--recover' option.  See <a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-http-fetch.html">git http-fetch</a>
for more information.</p>

<p>If one of the loose object fetches fails, Git will download the packfile indexes
looking for the sha that it needs, then download that packfile.</p>

<p>It is important if you are running a git server that serves repos this way to
implement a post-receive hook that runs the 'git update-server-info' command
each time or there will be confusion.</p>

<h3>Fetching Data with Upload Pack</h3>

<p>For the smarter protocols, fetching objects is much more efficient.  A socket
is opened, either over ssh or over port 9418 (in the case of the git:// protocol),
and the <a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-fetch-pack.html">git fetch-pack</a> command on the client begins communicating with
a forked <a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-upload-pack.html">git upload-pack</a> process on the server.</p>

<p>Then the server will tell the client which SHAs it has for each ref,
and the client figures out what it needs and responds with a list of SHAs it
wants and already has.</p>

<p>At this point, the server will generate a packfile with all the objects that
the client needs and begin streaming it down to the client.</p>

<p>Let's look at an example.</p>

<p>The client connects and sends the request header. The clone command</p>

<pre><code>$ git clone git://myserver.com/project.git
</code></pre>

<p>produces the following request:</p>

<pre><code>0032git-upload-pack /project.git\000host=myserver.com\000
</code></pre>

<p>The first four bytes contain the hex length of the line (including 4 byte line
length and trailing newline if present). Following are the command and
arguments. This is followed by a null byte and then the host information. The
request is terminated by a null byte.</p>

<p>The request is processed and turned into a call to git-upload-pack:</p>

<pre><code>$ git-upload-pack /path/to/repos/project.git
</code></pre>

<p>This immediately returns information of the repo:</p>

<pre><code>007c74730d410fcb6603ace96f1dc55ea6196122532d HEAD\000multi_ack thin-pack side-band side-band-64k ofs-delta shallow no-progress

003f74730d410fcb6603ace96f1dc55ea6196122532d refs/heads/master
0000
</code></pre>

<p>Each line starts with a four byte line length declaration in hex. The section
is terminated by a line length declaration of 0000.</p>

<p>This is sent back to the client verbatim. The client responds with another
request:</p>

<pre><code>0054want 74730d410fcb6603ace96f1dc55ea6196122532d multi_ack side-band-64k ofs-delta

0032want 74730d410fcb6603ace96f1dc55ea6196122532d
00000009done
</code></pre>

<p>The is sent to the open git-upload-pack process which then streams out the
final response:</p>

<pre><code>"0008NAK\n"

<p>See the Packfile chapter previously for the actual format of the packfile data
in the response.</p>

<h3>Pushing Data</h3>

<p>Pushing data over the git and ssh protocols is similar, but simpler.  Basically
what happens is the client requests a receive-pack instance, which is started
up if the client has access, then the server returns all the ref head shas it
has again and the client generates a packfile of everything the server needs
(generally only if what is on the server is a direct ancestor of what it is
pushing) and sends that packfile upstream, where the server either stores it
on disk and builds an index for it, or unpacks it (if there aren't many objects
in it)</p>

<p>This entire process is accomplished through the <a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-send-pack.html">git send-pack</a> command
on the client, which is invoked by <a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-push.html">git push</a> and the
<a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-receive-pack.html">git receive-pack</a> command on the server side, which is invoked by
the ssh connect process or git daemon (if it's an open push server).</p>

<h2>Glossary</h2>

<p>Here we have the meanings of some terms used into Git context.<br/>
These terms were entirely copied from
<a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/gitglossary.html">Git Glossary</a>.</p>

<p><em>alternate object database</em></p>

<blockquote><p>  Via the alternates mechanism, a repository</p>

<pre><code>can inherit part of its object database
from another object database, which is called "alternate". 
</code></pre></blockquote>

<p><em>bare repository</em></p>

<blockquote><p>  A bare repository is normally an appropriately</p>

<pre><code>named directory with a `.git` suffix that does not
have a locally checked-out copy of any of the files under
revision control. That is, all of the `git`
administrative and control files that would normally be present in the
hidden `.git` sub-directory are directly present in the
`repository.git` directory instead,
and no other files are present and checked out. Usually publishers of
public repositories make bare repositories available.
</code></pre></blockquote>

<p><em>blob object</em></p>

<blockquote><p>  Untyped object, e.g. the contents of a file.</p></blockquote>

<p><em>branch</em></p>

<blockquote><p>  A "branch" is an active line of development.  The most recent</p>

<pre><code>commit on a branch is referred to as the tip of
that branch.  The tip of the branch is referenced by a branch
head, which moves forward as additional development
is done on the branch.  A single git
repository can track an arbitrary number of
branches, but your working tree is
associated with just one of them (the "current" or "checked out"
branch), and HEAD points to that branch.
</code></pre></blockquote>

<p><em>cache</em></p>

<blockquote><p>  Obsolete for: index.</p></blockquote>

<p><em>chain</em></p>

<blockquote><p>  A list of objects, where each object in the list contains</p>

<pre><code>a reference to its successor (for example, the successor of a
commit could be one of its parents).
</code></pre></blockquote>

<p><em>changeset</em></p>

<blockquote><p>  BitKeeper/cvsps speak for "commit". Since git does not</p>

<pre><code>store changes, but states, it really does not make sense to use the term
"changesets" with git.
</code></pre></blockquote>

<p><em>checkout</em></p>

<blockquote><p>  The action of updating all or part of the</p>

<pre><code>working tree with a tree object
or blob from the
object database, and updating the
index and HEAD if the whole working tree has
been pointed at a new branch.
</code></pre></blockquote>

<p><em>cherry-picking</em></p>

<blockquote><p>  In SCM jargon, "cherry pick" means to choose a subset of</p>

<pre><code>changes out of a series of changes (typically commits) and record them
as a new series of changes on top of a different codebase. In GIT, this is
performed by the "git cherry-pick" command to extract the change introduced
by an existing commit and to record it based on the tip
of the current branch as a new commit.
</code></pre></blockquote>

<p><em>clean</em></p>

<blockquote><p>  A working tree is clean, if it</p>

<pre><code>corresponds to the revision referenced by the current
head. Also see "dirty".
</code></pre></blockquote>

<p><em>commit</em></p>

<blockquote><p>  As a noun: A single point in the</p>

<pre><code>git history; the entire history of a project is represented as a
set of interrelated commits.  The word "commit" is often
used by git in the same places other revision control systems
use the words "revision" or "version".  Also used as a short
hand for commit object.
</code></pre>

<p>  As a verb: The action of storing a new snapshot of the project's</p>

<pre><code>state in the git history, by creating a new commit representing the current
state of the index and advancing HEAD
to point at the new commit.
</code></pre></blockquote>

<p><em>commit object</em></p>

<blockquote><p>  An object which contains the information about a</p>

<pre><code>particular revision, such as parents, committer,
author, date and the tree object which corresponds
to the top directory of the stored
revision.
</code></pre></blockquote>

<p><em>core git</em></p>

<blockquote><p>  Fundamental data structures and utilities of git. Exposes only limited</p>

<pre><code>source code management tools.
</code></pre></blockquote>

<p><em>DAG</em></p>

<blockquote><p>  Directed acyclic graph. The commit objects form a</p>

<pre><code>directed acyclic graph, because they have parents (directed), and the
graph of commit objects is acyclic (there is no chain
which begins and ends with the same object).
</code></pre></blockquote>

<p><em>dangling object</em></p>

<blockquote><p>  An unreachable object which is not</p>

<pre><code>reachable even from other unreachable objects; a
dangling object has no references to it from any
reference or object in the repository.
</code></pre></blockquote>

<p><em>detached HEAD</em></p>

<blockquote><p>  Normally the HEAD stores the name of a</p>

<pre><code>branch.  However, git also allows you to check out
an arbitrary commit that isn't necessarily the tip of any
particular branch.  In this case HEAD is said to be "detached".
</code></pre></blockquote>

<p><em>dircache</em></p>

<blockquote><p>  You are <em>waaaaay</em> behind. See index.</p></blockquote>

<p><em>directory</em></p>

<blockquote><p>  The list you get with "ls" :-)</p></blockquote>

<p><em>dirty</em></p>

<blockquote><p>  A working tree is said to be "dirty" if</p>

<pre><code>it contains modifications which have not been committed to the current
branch.
</code></pre></blockquote>

<p><em>ent</em></p>

<blockquote><p>  Favorite synonym to "tree-ish" by some total geeks. See</p>

<pre><code>`http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ent_(Middle-earth)` for an in-depth
explanation. Avoid this term, not to confuse people.
</code></pre></blockquote>

<p><em>evil merge</em></p>

<blockquote><p>  An evil merge is a merge that introduces changes that</p>

<pre><code>do not appear in any parent.
</code></pre></blockquote>

<p><em>fast forward</em></p>

<blockquote><p>  A fast-forward is a special type of merge where you have a</p>

<pre><code>revision and you are "merging" another
branch's changes that happen to be a descendant of what
you have. In such these cases, you do not make a new merge
commit but instead just update to his
revision. This will happen frequently on a
tracking branch of a remote
repository.
</code></pre></blockquote>

<p><em>fetch</em></p>

<blockquote><p>  Fetching a branch means to get the</p>

<pre><code>branch's head ref from a remote
repository, to find out which objects are
missing from the local object database,
and to get them, too.  See also <a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-fetch.html">git fetch</a>.
</code></pre></blockquote>

<p><em>file system</em></p>

<blockquote><p>  Linus Torvalds originally designed git to be a user space file system,</p>

<pre><code>i.e. the infrastructure to hold files and directories. That ensured the
efficiency and speed of git.
</code></pre></blockquote>

<p><em>git archive</em></p>

<blockquote><p>  Synonym for repository (for arch people).</p></blockquote>

<p><em>grafts</em></p>

<blockquote><p>  Grafts enables two otherwise different lines of development to be joined</p>

<pre><code>together by recording fake ancestry information for commits. This way
you can make git pretend the set of parents a commit has
is different from what was recorded when the commit was
created. Configured via the `.git/info/grafts` file.
</code></pre></blockquote>

<p><em>hash</em></p>

<blockquote><p>  In git's context, synonym to object name.</p></blockquote>

<p><em>head</em></p>

<blockquote><p>  A named reference to the commit at the tip of a</p>

<pre><code>branch.  Heads are stored in
`$GIT_DIR/refs/heads/`, except when using packed refs. (See
<a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-pack-refs.html">git pack-refs</a>.)
</code></pre></blockquote>

<p><em>HEAD</em></p>

<blockquote><p>  The current branch.  In more detail: Your working tree is normally derived</p>

<pre><code>from the state of the tree referred to by HEAD.  HEAD is a reference to one
of the heads in your repository, except when using a detached HEAD, in which
case it may reference an arbitrary commit.
</code></pre></blockquote>

<p><em>head ref</em></p>

<blockquote><p>  A synonym for head.</p></blockquote>

<p><em>hook</em></p>

<blockquote><p>  During the normal execution of several git commands, call-outs are made</p>

<pre><code>to optional scripts that allow a developer to add functionality or
checking. Typically, the hooks allow for a command to be pre-verified
and potentially aborted, and allow for a post-notification after the
operation is done. The hook scripts are found in the
`$GIT_DIR/hooks/` directory, and are enabled by simply
removing the `.sample` suffix from the filename. In earlier versions
of git you had to make them executable.
</code></pre></blockquote>

<p><em>index</em></p>

<blockquote><p>  A collection of files with stat information, whose contents are stored</p>

<pre><code>as objects. The index is a stored version of your
working tree. Truth be told, it can also contain a second, and even
a third version of a working tree, which are used
when merging.
</code></pre></blockquote>

<p><em>index entry</em></p>

<blockquote><p>  The information regarding a particular file, stored in the</p>

<pre><code>index. An index entry can be unmerged, if a
merge was started, but not yet finished (i.e. if
the index contains multiple versions of that file).
</code></pre></blockquote>

<p><em>master</em></p>

<blockquote><p>  The default development branch. Whenever you</p>

<pre><code>create a git repository, a branch named
"master" is created, and becomes the active branch. In most
cases, this contains the local development, though that is
purely by convention and is not required.
</code></pre></blockquote>

<p><em>merge</em></p>

<blockquote><p>  As a verb: To bring the contents of another</p>

<pre><code>branch (possibly from an external
repository) into the current branch.  In the
case where the merged-in branch is from a different repository,
this is done by first fetching the remote branch
and then merging the result into the current branch.  This
combination of fetch and merge operations is called a
pull.  Merging is performed by an automatic process
that identifies changes made since the branches diverged, and
then applies all those changes together.  In cases where changes
conflict, manual intervention may be required to complete the
merge.
</code></pre>

<p>  As a noun: unless it is a fast forward, a</p>

<pre><code>successful merge results in the creation of a new commit
representing the result of the merge, and having as
parents the tips of the merged branches.
This commit is referred to as a "merge commit", or sometimes just a
"merge".
</code></pre></blockquote>

<p><em>object</em></p>

<blockquote><p>  The unit of storage in git. It is uniquely identified by the</p>

<pre><code>SHA1&gt; of its contents. Consequently, an
object can not be changed.
</code></pre></blockquote>

<p><em>object database</em></p>

<blockquote><p>  Stores a set of "objects", and an individual object is</p>

<pre><code>identified by its object name. The objects usually
live in `$GIT_DIR/objects/`.
</code></pre></blockquote>

<p><em>object identifier</em></p>

<blockquote><p>  Synonym for object name.</p></blockquote>

<p><em>object name</em></p>

<blockquote><p>  The unique identifier of an object. The hash</p>

<pre><code>of the object's contents using the Secure Hash Algorithm
1 and usually represented by the 40 character hexadecimal encoding of
the hash of the object.
</code></pre></blockquote>

<p><em>object type</em></p>

<blockquote><p>  One of the identifiers "commit", "tree", "tag" or "blob" describing the</p>

<pre><code>type of an object.
</code></pre></blockquote>

<p><em>octopus</em></p>

<blockquote><p>  To merge more than two branches. Also denotes an</p>

<pre><code>intelligent predator.
</code></pre></blockquote>

<p><em>origin</em></p>

<blockquote><p>  The default upstream repository. Most projects have</p>

<pre><code>at least one upstream project which they track. By default
'origin' is used for that purpose. New upstream updates
will be fetched into remote tracking branches named
origin/name-of-upstream-branch, which you can see using
"`git branch -r`".
</code></pre></blockquote>

<p><em>pack</em></p>

<blockquote><p>  A set of objects which have been compressed into one file (to save space</p>

<pre><code>or to transmit them efficiently).
</code></pre></blockquote>

<p><em>pack index</em></p>

<blockquote><p>  The list of identifiers, and other information, of the objects in a</p>

<pre><code>pack, to assist in efficiently accessing the contents of a
pack.
</code></pre></blockquote>

<p><em>parent</em></p>

<blockquote><p>  A commit object contains a (possibly empty) list</p>

<pre><code>of the logical predecessor(s) in the line of development, i.e. its
parents.
</code></pre></blockquote>

<p><em>pickaxe</em></p>

<blockquote><p>  The term pickaxe refers to an option to the diffcore</p>

<pre><code>routines that help select changes that add or delete a given text
string. With the `--pickaxe-all` option, it can be used to view the full
changeset that introduced or removed, say, a
particular line of text. See <a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-diff.html">git diff</a>.
</code></pre></blockquote>

<p><em>plumbing</em></p>

<blockquote><p>  Cute name for core git.</p></blockquote>

<p><em>porcelain</em></p>

<blockquote><p>  Cute name for programs and program suites depending on</p>

<pre><code>core git, presenting a high level access to
core git. Porcelains expose more of a SCM
interface than the plumbing.
</code></pre></blockquote>

<p><em>pull</em></p>

<blockquote><p>  Pulling a branch means to fetch it and</p>

<pre><code>merge it.  See also <a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-pull.html">git pull</a>.
</code></pre></blockquote>

<p><em>push</em></p>

<blockquote><p>  Pushing a branch means to get the branch's</p>

<pre><code>head ref from a remote repository,
find out if it is a direct ancestor to the branch's local
head ref, and in that case, putting all
objects, which are reachable from the local
head ref, and which are missing from the remote
repository, into the remote
object database, and updating the remote
head ref. If the remote head is not an
ancestor to the local head, the push fails.
</code></pre></blockquote>

<p><em>reachable</em></p>

<blockquote><p>  All of the ancestors of a given commit are said to be</p>

<pre><code>"reachable" from that commit. More
generally, one object is reachable from
another if we can reach the one from the other by a chain
that follows tags to whatever they tag,
commits to their parents or trees, and
trees to the trees or blobs
that they contain.
</code></pre></blockquote>

<p><em>rebase</em></p>

<blockquote><p>  To reapply a series of changes from a branch to a</p>

<pre><code>different base, and reset the head of that branch
to the result.
</code></pre></blockquote>

<p><em>ref</em></p>

<blockquote><p>  A 40-byte hex representation of a SHA1 or a name that</p>

<pre><code>denotes a particular object. These may be stored in
`$GIT_DIR/refs/`.
</code></pre></blockquote>

<p><em>reflog</em></p>

<blockquote><p>  A reflog shows the local "history" of a ref.  In other words,</p>

<pre><code>it can tell you what the 3rd last revision in _this_ repository
was, and what was the current state in _this_ repository,
yesterday 9:14pm.  See <a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-reflog.html">git reflog</a> for details.
</code></pre></blockquote>

<p><em>refspec</em></p>

<blockquote><p>  A "refspec" is used by fetch and</p>

<pre><code>push to describe the mapping between remote
ref and local ref. They are combined with a colon in
the format &lt;src&gt;:&lt;dst&gt;, preceded by an optional plus sign, +.
For example: `git fetch $URL
refs/heads/master:refs/heads/origin` means "grab the master
branch head from the $URL and store
it as my origin branch head". And `git push
$URL refs/heads/master:refs/heads/to-upstream` means "publish my
master branch head as to-upstream branch at $URL". See also
<a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-push.html">git push</a>.
</code></pre></blockquote>

<p><em>repository</em></p>

<blockquote><p>  A collection of refs together with an</p>

<pre><code>object database containing all objects
which are reachable from the refs, possibly
accompanied by meta data from one or more porcelains. A
repository can share an object database with other repositories
via alternates mechanism.
</code></pre></blockquote>

<p><em>resolve</em></p>

<blockquote><p>  The action of fixing up manually what a failed automatic</p>

<pre><code>merge left behind.
</code></pre></blockquote>

<p><em>revision</em></p>

<blockquote><p>  A particular state of files and directories which was stored in the</p>

<pre><code>object database. It is referenced by a
commit object.

<p><em>rewind</em></p>

<blockquote><p>  To throw away part of the development, i.e. to assign the</p>

<pre><code>head to an earlier revision.
</code></pre></blockquote>

<p><em>SCM</em></p>

<blockquote><p>  Source code management (tool).</p></blockquote>

<p><em>SHA1</em></p>

<blockquote><p>  Synonym for object name.</p></blockquote>

<p><em>shallow repository</em></p>

<blockquote><p>  A shallow repository has an incomplete</p>

<pre><code>history some of whose commits have parents cauterized away (in other
words, git is told to pretend that these commits do not have the
parents, even though they are recorded in the commit
object). This is sometimes useful when you are interested only in the
recent history of a project even though the real history recorded in the
upstream is much larger. A shallow repository
is created by giving the `--depth` option to <a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-clone.html">git clone</a>, and
its history can be later deepened with <a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-fetch.html">git fetch</a>.
</code></pre></blockquote>

<p><em>symref</em></p>

<blockquote><p>  Symbolic reference: instead of containing the SHA1</p>

<pre><code>id itself, it is of the format 'ref: refs/some/thing' and when
referenced, it recursively dereferences to this reference.
'HEAD' is a prime example of a symref. Symbolic
references are manipulated with the <a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-symbolic-ref.html">git symbolic-ref</a>
command.
</code></pre></blockquote>

<p><em>tag</em></p>

<blockquote><p>  A ref pointing to a tag or</p>

<pre><code>commit object. In contrast to a head,
a tag is not changed by a commit. Tags (not
tag objects) are stored in `$GIT_DIR/refs/tags/`. A
git tag has nothing to do with a Lisp tag (which would be
called an object type in git's context). A
tag is most typically used to mark a particular point in the
commit ancestry chain.
</code></pre></blockquote>

<p><em>tag object</em></p>

<blockquote><p>  An object containing a ref pointing to</p>

<pre><code>another object, which can contain a message just like a
commit object. It can also contain a (PGP)
signature, in which case it is called a "signed tag object".
</code></pre></blockquote>

<p><em>topic branch</em></p>

<blockquote><p>  A regular git branch that is used by a developer to</p>

<pre><code>identify a conceptual line of development. Since branches are very easy
and inexpensive, it is often desirable to have several small branches
that each contain very well defined concepts or small incremental yet
related changes.
</code></pre></blockquote>

<p><em>tracking branch</em></p>

<blockquote><p>  A regular git branch that is used to follow changes from</p>

<pre><code>another repository. A tracking
branch should not contain direct modifications or have local commits
made to it. A tracking branch can usually be
identified as the right-hand-side ref in a Pull:
refspec.
</code></pre></blockquote>

<p><em>tree</em></p>

<blockquote><p>  Either a working tree, or a tree object together with the dependent</p>

<pre><code>blob and tree objects (i.e. a stored representation of a working tree).
</code></pre></blockquote>

<p><em>tree object</em></p>

<blockquote><p>  An object containing a list of file names and modes along</p>

<pre><code>with refs to the associated blob and/or tree objects. A
tree is equivalent to a directory.
</code></pre></blockquote>

<p><em>tree-ish</em></p>

<blockquote><p>  A ref pointing to either a commit object, a tree object, or a tag</p>

<pre><code>object pointing to a tag or commit or tree object.
</code></pre></blockquote>

<p><em>unmerged index</em></p>

<blockquote><p>  An index which contains unmerged</p>

<pre><code>index entries.
</code></pre></blockquote>

<p><em>unreachable object</em></p>

<blockquote><p>  An object which is not reachable from a</p>

<pre><code>branch, tag, or any other reference.
</code></pre></blockquote>

<p><em>working tree</em></p>

<blockquote><p>  The tree of actual checked out files.  The working tree is</p>

<pre><code>normally equal to the HEAD plus any local changes
that you have made but not yet committed.
